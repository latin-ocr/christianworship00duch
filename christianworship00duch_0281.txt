THE cunisrrAN FESTIVALS. 259

there was no observance of this feast either at Jerusalem,l
or at Alexandria. It was adopted at the latter place about
430.2 The Armenians did not observe it either.3 These
Churches, however, had a festival of the same import, or of a
significance similar to that of the Latin festival of the 25th
of December. This was what they called the festival of
“ the ManifestationS‚'' τὰ Ἐπιφάνια, or Epiphany, which they
celebrated on the 6th of January. The most ancient indica-
tion of this festival is to be found in Clement of Alexandria.
He states that the Basilidians celebrated the day of Christ’s
baptism by a festival which was preceded by a Vigil, or
Watch, spent in hearing lections.4 There was a variation,
however, as to the date. Some celebrated this festival on
the lOth, others on the Gth of January. It is not possible to
say at what exact date this custom was introduced into the
orthodox Churches of the East, but it is certain that in the
course of the fourth century the festival of the ssth of
January was univerally observed among them. Three events
were commemorated in this festival-the birth of Christ, the
adoration of the Magi, and the baptism of our Lord. The most
ancient mention of this feast is found in the Passion of St.
Philip, Bishop of Heraclea in Thrace, where there is mention
of an incident which occurred in the time of the Diocletian

¹ This is borne out by the Pereqrinatio Elheriae (Silviae), and also by a
sermon of St. J erome delivered at Bethlehem in one of the early years of the
fifth century. This sermon has been recently dealt with by Gr. Mol-in
(Revue d’Hist. et de Litte‘r. Reliqieuses‚ vol. i.‚ 1896, p. 414). The ancient
custom was still in vogue at Jerusalem in the sixth century (Gosmas
Indicopl„ in Migne, Pat. Gr„ vol. lxxxviii. p. 197).

² Cassian, Gozl„ x. 1; Gennadius, De Visite, 59. Paul, Bishop of Emesa,
preached a sermon on Sunday, the 25th of December (29 Khoiak), in the
year 432, in the great church of Alexandria, from which it appears that
this day was observed there in remembrance of the birth of our Lord
(Hardouin, Cone„ vol. i. p. 1693).
