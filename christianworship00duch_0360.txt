received and as of long standing. In his controversy with
Marcion,l he witnesses to the fact that the followers of this
heretic used the same baptismal ritual as that of the Church
Catholic‚ and specifies the baptism with water, the unction‚
the signing on the forehead‚ and the drink of milk and
honey. Besides this, we 616 aware that the Valentinians
and other Gnostic sects attached great importance to

itself.2 It is difficult to believe3 that 111666 very early
66016 did not borrow the customs in question from a 1111161

the Church, whatever may have been the subsequent
modifications which they introduced into it in other
respectS.

Whatever view may be taken of this chronological
discussion of the ceremonies of unction, the signing of the
cross, and the drink of milk and honey, it is 06116111 that
the division of the initiation into two distinct acts, such
66 we find already in the New Testament‚ was maintained

when the controversy arose with regard to the baptism
of 116161106.

It is clear that ceremonies of such importance were
presided over by the bishop. As, however, they might
have become interminable had the bishop himself performed
all the rites in connection with the initiation‚ a division
of functions was made at an early date. The bishop blessed
the holy oils and the font, and baptised with his own hand
some of the neophytes. The priestS, assisted by ministers
