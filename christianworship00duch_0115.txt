THE TWO LITURGIGAL USES OF THE LATIN WEST. 95

However this may be, the important political position of
the city of Milan was not maintained beyond the early years
of the fifth century. The glory of its episcopal see was
dimmed at the same time, and Rome found herself thus
relieved from a competition which might have ended in the
establishment of a rival. It was scarcely possible, indeed,
to undo an accomplished fact. The Popes considered,
apparently, that no inconvenience would arise if liturgical
usages somewhat different from their own were allowed to
continue; in any case, there were more urgent questions
secking solution. They confined their efforts to defending
their metropolitan diocese from the invasion of the Gallican
ritual, and left the Churches of other provinces to make their
arrangements on this point as they felt inclined. Circum-
stances, moreover‚ were not favourable to the development of
ecclesiastical centralisation. National barriers soon rose up
between Rome and the Ohurches of the barbaric kingdoms
founded in Gaul and Spain.l

¹ The view that I have just put forward has, from the first edition of
this book⁷ been contested by divers persons. These among them whose
opinion is of weight, put forward another explanation. The Gallioan
ritual, according to them, is none other than the ancient Roman ritual,
which, reformed at Rome in the fourth century‚wmaintained its position
in the provinces. They give even the name of the reformor—Pope
Damasus. Unfortunately, however, they are not able to adduce testimony,
either on his behalf, or that of any other. This new hypothesis is not
more fully supported by documentary evidence than mine. Morewer, how
could we explain, on this assumption, the fact that Pope Innocent, far
from recognising the ancient use of his own Chu1·ch in the Gallican ritual,
treats it as of foreign importation (aliunde acceptum exemplum? How,
also, can we explain why Africa, so jealous of its own peculiarities, was
keen to accept the Roman reform, while St. Amin-ose, Roman by birth and
disposition, refused to introduce it into his Ohurch? comparing hypothesis
with hypothesis, I continue to believe that mine is more in conformity with
facts and situations than the other. Nevertheless, it is to be well under-
stood that Ι do not put it forth as a definitive solution. I am ready to
abandon it if any one can put forth a better. Cf. my article entitled, ‘⁶ Sur
l’Origine de la Liturgie Gallicane,⁷' in the Revue d'Hist. de Litt. Rei, 1900,
