without the slightest trace of Roman influence. It is
arranged according to the order of the Gallican ecclesiastical
year, and this constitutes its great interest. The festivals
of the saints given are few in number, that of St. Genevieve
being the only one Which might furnish us with any indi-

discovered at Luxeuil, it contains nothing Which relates
particularly to that region. Dom Morin1 is of opinion
that it represents the use of the Ohurch of Paris.

reason to doubt the authenticity of this heading. St.
Germain of Paris, who flourished from 555-576, is well

two letters. The first deals with the Mass, the second
With certain particular details, ceremonies for special
occasions, and liturgical vestments. In order to explain
the rituaL the venerable author is obliged to give a summary
description of it, and in this lies the peculiar interest for
us of his explanation.4
