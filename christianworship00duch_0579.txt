marbles, as far as the resources of his kingdom allowed him,
that is, the greater church as well as the Anastasis, at the
Cross, and the other Holy Places in Jerusalem? But to return
to the matter in hand: the Dismissal takes place on the
first day in the greater church, which is in Golgotha, and
when they preach or read the several lessons, or recite hymns,
all are appropriate to the day. And afterwards when the
Dismissal from the church has been made, they repair to the
Anastasis With hymns, according to custom‚ so that the Dis-
missal takes place about the sixth hour. And on this day
lacernam also is said according to the daily use.

3. Octava of the Festival.

On the second day also they proceed in like manner to the
church in Golgotha„ and also on the third day3 thus the feast is
celebrated with all this joyfulness for three days up to the sixth
hour in the church built by Constantine. On the fourth day it
is celebrated in like manner with similar festa] array in Eleona,
the very beautiful church which stands on the Mount of Olives 3
on the fifth day in the Lazarium, which is distant about one
thousand five hundred paces from J erusalen13 on the sixth day
in Syon, on the seventh day in the Anastasis, and on the eighth
day at the Oross. Thus, then, is the feast celebrated with all
this joyfulness and festal array throughout the eight days in
all the Holy Places which I have mentioned above. And in
Bethlehem also throughout the entire eight days the feast is
celebrated with similar festal array and joyfulness daily by the
Priests and by all the Olergy there, and by the Monks who are
appointed in that place. For from the hour when all return by
night to Jerusalem with the Bishop, the Monks of that place 1 keep
vigil in the church in Bethlehem, reciting hymns and antiphone,
but it is necessary that the Bishop should always keep these
days in Jerusalem. And immense crowds, not of Monks only,
but also of the laity‚ both men and women, flock together to
Jerusalem from every quarter for the solemn and joyous observ-

ance of that day.
