festivals on the same footing as the Epiphany1 in this
respect. The Popes, however, urgently insisted upon, and
succeeded in securing—not, it is true, without difficulty—-
the observance by the Latin Ohurches of the ancient Roman
custom, which had its origin at a period long anterior to
the institution of the festival of the Nativity.

The rites observed in regard to the catechumenam,
baptism, and confirmation, varied, as was the case with
the Eucharistic Liturgy, according to the country. I will
describe in the following pages the various customs.

§L-——BAPTIsM AccoamNc To THE ROMAN UsAGE.

The documents from which we gather the baptismal
ceremonies of the Roman Church are as follows :—

1. The Ordo Baptismi, published by Mabillon as
No. VII. This Ordo, as far as the text is concerned, goes
back, at least, to the time of Charlemagne. We find it
almost in its entirety, and word for word, in an instruction
on baptism given by J esse, Bishop of Amiens, to the clergy
of his diocese, probably in 8122

2. The Sacramenta-ry of Pope Adrian, which furnishes
but few details, except in regard to the final ceremony.

¹ Cf. letter from siricius to Himerus of Tarragona, c. 2. It appears
to have had no effect, for the Gouncil of the Province of Tarragona
still recognised, in 517, Christmas as a baptis-mal festival (Cone. Gerund,
ο. 4); the letter of St. Leo to the Bishops of Sicily (Jaffe', 414, c. 1);
the letter of Gelasius to the Bishops of Lucania, etc„ c. 12. Victor
Vitensis, Hist. Perseo. Vamlccl, ii. 47 ; Synoclus Patricii, ii. 19 (Hardouin,
vol. i. p. 1795). From these last two authorities it would appear that
the Epiphany was a baptismal festival both in Africa and in Ireland.
The Councils of Macon (585), ο. 3, and Auxerre (circ. 585), show
that the Roman custom prcvailed in Gaul towards the end of the sixth
century. For the East, see especially Gregory Nazianzen‚ hom. 403
various homines of st. John Chrysostom, vol. ii. pp. 268, 433; vol. xi,
P. 25; Theodoret, Hist. Ecoz„ ii. 27.
