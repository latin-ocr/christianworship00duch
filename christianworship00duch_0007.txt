AUTHOR’s PREFACE.

 

 

THIS volume contains the description and explanation
of the chief ceremonies of Catholic worship as they
were performed in the Latin Ohurches of the West
from the fourth to the ninth century. The title is
somewhat ambitione, and is not exactly that which
I would have chosen. But Ι did not feel justified
in disregarding the suggestions of my publisher, and
have had to relegate to the sub-title the description
which I had in view.

The contents represent, in the main, merely notes
of my lectures. I have dealt with this subject on
two or three occasions in my teaching at the Iozstz'tut
Catlzoliquc at Paris. My pupils and other persons
having expressed a wish to have the lecturcs
printed, I am now able to satisfy their desire.

It is, indeed, but a modest contribution to the
subject, and Ι make no pretension to compare this
little book with the great works of the French and
foreign liturgiologists, who, from the seventeenth
century onwards, have explored every department of
this vast domain. Small books, however, have their
use, and mine, perhaps, may be welcomed by beginners
who want a general view of the subject, or by busy

people who are engaged in kindred studies and desire
