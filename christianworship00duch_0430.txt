404 CHR1ST1AN WORSHIP: 1Ts omem AND EVOLUTION.

(538). We learn from this that about the middle of
the sixth century the Roman Church had not yet a ritual
for the dedication of churches. A church was dedicated
by the simple fact that Mass had been solemnly said
within it. In the case, however, of a church having
relics, these had to be deposited in it before the saying
of the first Mass. Aspersions with holy water, which
form so important a part in the existing ritual, are only
mentioned to be exoluded.1 They found no place in Roman
usage.

About sixty years later the letters of St. Gregory
mention the dedication of churches2 somewhat frequently.
In the metropolitan diocese of the Pope no rural church

could be consecrated without his authorisation‚ and to
this circumstance we owe the frequent mention of these

ceremonies in the papal correspondence. The Liber
diurnus contains a score of formularies of the Roman
usage.³ I can discover nothing in these documents
which implies, everything considered, another ritual than
that referred to by Pope Vigssius.‘²

¹ “De fabrica vero cujuslibet ecclesiae, si ffiruta fuerit et si in eo
loco consecrationis solemnitas debeat iterari in quo sanctuaria non fuerint,
nihil judicamus officere si per eam minime aqua exorcizata jactetur: quia
consecrationem cujuslibet ecclesiae in qua sanctuaria non ponuntur cele-
britatem tantum scimus esse missarum. Et ideo, si qua sanctorum
basilica a fundamentis etiam fuerit innovata, sine aliqua dubitatione, cum
in ea missarum fuerit celebrata solemnitas, totius sanctificatio conse-
crationis impletur. Si vero sanctuaria quae habebat ablata sunt, rursus
earum depositione et missarum solemnitate reverentiam sanctificationis
accipiet.⁷’

⁴¹ We meet sometimes with celebrated dedicatione absque missis publicis;
but these are cases of monastic oratories not open to the public, and where,
consequently, missae publicae could not be celebrated. As the edifice was
never to serve sor public Messes, it is quite matura] that these should not
be said at the dedication.
