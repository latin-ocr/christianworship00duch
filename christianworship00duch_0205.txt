THE ROMAN MAss. 183

moreover, by the fact that the blessing of aliments took
place, on certain days, at this point in the Mass, as, for
instance, the drink made of water milk and honey, which
was given to the neophytes at Easter and Pentecost. I
append the formulary of this benediction‚ according to the
Leonian Sacramentary‚ for the first Mass at Pentecost 1—-

Benedic, Domine, et has tuas creaturas fontis, mellis et lactis, et pota
famulos tuos ex hoc fonte aquae vitae perennis qui 661 Spiritus veritatis,
et enutri eos de hoc lacte et melle, quemadmodum patribus nostris
Abraham, Isaac et Jacob [1110111161611]2 introducere 16 606 111 16116111
promissionis, terram fluentem melle et lacte. Conjunge ergo famulos
tuos, Domine, Spiritui sancto, sicut conjunctum est hoc mel et lac, quo
caelestis terrenaeque substantiae significatur unitio in Christo Jesu
Domino nostro, per quem haec omnia, etc.

It was also at this place that the new beans were

blessed on Ascension Day, and the new grapes on the
day of St. Sixtus (August 6).3

Remedio, Domine, et hasfruyes novas fabae, etc.
Remedio, Domine, et lzosfructus novos uvae, etc.

Finally, it was at this point that the 011 for the
unction of the sick was blessed, and still is blessed, on
Maundy Thursday.

There is no doubt, therefore, that the formulary per
quem haee omma was originally preceded, and that, too,
apart from these extraordinary occasions, by a prayer for
the fruits of the earth. This furnishes a further instance
of the resemblance of the Roman Canon to the corre-
sponding portion of the Greek and Eastern Liturgies.
