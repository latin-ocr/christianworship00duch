THE ROMAN MASS. 181

that which it is to-day. The final formulary, in fact, in all
this series of enumerations, namely, that which appears
before the Qui pridie, is already met with in the De
sacramentis, in terms almost identical with those of the
present Quam oblationem. The letter of Pope Innocent to
Decentius assumes, moreover, that the recitation of the
diptychs occupied at Rome in 416, and for a long time
previously, the place which it holds at present.

The account of the institution (Qui pridie) and the
Anamnesis (Unde et memores), which follows it, present
nothing peculiar. The same may be said of the Epiclesis.

This portion of the Canon runs as follows :—

Supra quae (the oblations) propitio ac sereno vultu respicere digneris
et accepta habere, sicuti accepta habere dignatus es munera pueri
tui justi Abel et sacrificium patriarchae nostri Abrahae, et quod tibi
obtulit summus sacerdos tuus Melchisedech [sanctum sacrificium, im-
maculatam hostiam} Supplices te rogamus, omnipotens Deus, jube
haec perferri per manus sancti angeli tui in sublime altare tuum, in
conspectu divinae majestatis tuae, ut quotquot ex hac altaris partici—
patione sacrosanctum Filii tui corpus et sanguinem sumpserimus, omni
benedictione caelesti et gratia repleamur.

This prayer is far from exhibiting the precision of the
Greek formularies, in which there is a specific mention of the
grace prayed for, that is, the intervention of the Holy Spirit
to effect the transformation of the bread and wine into the
Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. It is true, nevertheless‚
(1) that it occupies, in regard to the subject-matter and the
logical connection of the formulary, the exact place of the
Greek Epiclesis; and (2) that it also is a prayer to God for
His intervention in the mystery. But whilst the Greek
Liturgies use here clear and simple terms, the Roman
Liturgy embodies its meaning in symbolical forms. It prays
that the angel of the Lord may take the oblation from the
visible altar and bear it to the highest heaven, to the
