December 26, St. Stephen.
27, SS. J ames and John.

28, SS. Peter and Paul.

The coincidence is complete. It is not, moreover, an
isolated instance. The Nestorian and Armenian Churches
furnish in their respective calendars evident traces of the
same custom. The Armenians have not the festival of
Christmas in their calendar,1 yet, before they begin on the
29111 of December to make immediate preparation for the
observance of the Epiphany‚ they celebrate the four follow-

brother of the Lord, and of David, “ancestor of Godfi It is certain that
this festival is of Palestinian origin. Oosmas Indicopleustes testifies that
it was still celebrated in his time at Jerusalem (Migne, Pat. Gr.⁵ vol.
lxxxviii. p. 197).

³ This festival is, Ι think, a transformation of the primitive festival of
the two sons of Zebedee. St. John must have attracted to him the three
