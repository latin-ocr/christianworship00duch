in the ancient Sacramentary of Gellona (eighth to ninth
century), where it is accompanied by the explanation Secun-
dum Gallos. As far as Rome was concerned‚ the festival of
the 22nd of February was maintained to the exclusion of the
other, and that, too, down to the sixteenth century.1

A third festival of St. Peter was celebrated at Rome on
the lst of August. This was the festival of the Dedication of
the Ohurch of the Apostles? on the Esquiline, Which was re-
built in the time of Xystus [Sixtus] HI. <432-440) at the
cest of the Imperial family of the East. In this church were
preserved, as much-venerated relies, the chains of St. Peter,
by which name the basilica itself was frequently designated.8

¹ De Rossi, Ball„ 1807, p. 35. Tho conclusions arrived at in this
learned inemoir differ from mine. 'rho differenee must not be attributed to
a superficial exainination on my part of the reasons alleged and of the
solutions set aside. I ain unable to admit, in particular, that there was any
connection, before the later Middle Ages, between the A'otaetle cathedrae S.
Petri and tho cult of the relic venerated at Rome under the name of Chair
of st. Peter. The texts addueed to prove that this chair was in existence
ns early as the fourth century iu ihc baptistcry of the Vatican have not the
meaning assigned to thern. They speak of the Sedes Petri, or Sedes AposioZIc.c‚
only iu a rnetaphorical sense. 'l'he statement of Ennodius as to a sella qesta-
toria, has reference to the sella on which the consuls were carried iu the
consular processione (Rae-ne de I'Iciloloqie, vol. vii. (1533), p. Sl). Tho most
ancient mention of a relic thus called is in the catalogue of Mouza, of the
tinie of St. Gregory and Queen Theodelinda (De Rossi, Roma Sota, vol. i. p.
176) ε Oleo cle sede ubi prius sedit S. Petrus. This oil had been obtained en the
Via Salaria, or Via Nomentana, far from the Vatican. Here was a cemetery
called sometimes Ad Nymphas S. Petri, where, it is said, St. Peter baptised.
This tradition is referred to early in the sixth century in the Gesta Liberii
papae and the Passio Marcelli. There was in that place, doubtless, a mov-
able chair, or perhaps a chair cut in the tufa, which was regarded as a Sedes
S. Patri. As to that of the Vatican, unlike in shape and size to anything iu
the Cataeembs, I know of no mention of it before 1217 (Nerini, De templo
S. Αἰεωίί, p. 209). Peter Mallius, writing of the basilica of St. Peter (1159-
1181), does not allude to it ; and considering how eonstantly hc enlarges on the
relies therein,his silence shows that no chair of St. Peter was venerated then.

² Philip, a priest of this church, was a legate at the Oouncil of Ephesus
(431) (Hard, vol. i. p. 1483). It existed, therefore, before Xystus 111.

³ This designation, a vinculis S. Petri, is first met with in the Lib. Pont„
vol. i. p. 261, in the account of an event in 501, and in an inscription of 533
(ibid, p. 285). The poem of Arator, read in this basilica in 544, mentions tho
chains.
