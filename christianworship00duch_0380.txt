et propter Deum cum fiducia exeat et dicat. Verumtamen memor sit
communionis suae.

This is the formulary of the Gelasian Sacramentary
(i. 20); the other two do not contain it. The Ordo IX.
and that of St. Amand have formularies almost identical.
According to the rubric of the Gelasian Sacramentary, it
is the Pope who delivers the address: adnunciat pontefex
in populo, dicens. One of the Ordines assigns this duty
to a lector, while the other refers it to a scriniarius, or
notary. These two terms must be considered as meaning
the same thing, for in the first case the word lector does
not designate a cleric of that order, but the person who is
performing the function at the moment. We may conclude,
moreover, that, although the formulary is given in the
Gelasian Ordo as pronounced by the Pope and drawn up
in his name, it was always read by some one acting on
his behalf.

The candidates for ordination were stationed at a certain
place where they could be well seen and their identity
well established. This public probation had been preceded
by a declaration, made before the highest dignitaries of
the Ohurch, in which the candidate had to swear that he
had never committed any of the four heincus sins, the
commission of which, according to the discipline of the
tinne,l was an impediment to the reception of orders.

¹ These sins are enumerated in the Ordo VIII. of Mabillon: they
were: sodomy‚ bestiality, adultery‚ violation of consecrated virgins. This
enumeration does not include all the sins, whether secret or open, which
in the ancient discipline were subject to public-penance‚ and constituted
thus a bar to orders. There is, therefore, a difficulty here which, as far
as Ι 5111 aware, has never been satisfactorily solved. I consider, for my
part, that these interrogatories preliminary to ordination go back to a
time when baptism was received at adult age, and that it had not in view
the present condition of the conscience of the candidate, but his conduct
before having received baptism. While proclaiming the remissiori of sins,
however heincus they might be, by virtue of the sacrament of baptism
