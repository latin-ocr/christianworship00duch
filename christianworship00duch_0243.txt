THE GALLIOAN MAss. 221

When the chant was ended, the Lord's Prayer‚1 with, as
in all the liturgies, a short preface at the beginning and an
elaboration of the Libera nos a malo at the end, was then
said. Ι append the text of the latter from the Missale

Gothicum for Christmas Day—

Non nostro praesumentes, Pater sancte, merim, sed domini nostri
J esu Christi Filii tui obedientes imperio, audemus dicere:

Pater noster, etc.
Libera nos⁷ omnipotens Deus, ab omni malo, ab omni periculo, et

custodi nos in omni opere bono, perfecta veritas et vera libertas, Deus,
qui regnas in saecula saeculorum.

The Pater noster was said, not only by the priest, but
also by the congregation? At present the participation of
the congregation is confined, in the Mozarabic rite, to the
reciting of Amen to each os the petitions in the Pater
noster.

Then came the rite of the Oommixtio. The celebrant
dipped one 01· more of the consecrated particles into the
ohalice. In the Mozarabic rite of the present day it is
the particle reynum which is used for this purpose. The
celebrant holds it over the chalice and says thrice—

Vicit leo de tribu J uda, radix David, alleluia.

To which is said the response—

Qui sedes super Cherubim, radix David, alleluia.

¹ This is the last of the seven prayors enumerated by St. Isidore (op.
cit.): “Harum ultima est oratio qua Dominus noster discipulos suos orare
instituit‚’' eto. In Spain it was customary to recitc the Nicene Creed
before 1116 Pater noster. This custom was instituted by a decree of the
third Council of Toledo (589), c. 2 (cf. Isidore, op. cit„ c. 16).

² Greg. Tur.‚ Virt. S. Martini, ii. 30. This is the Greek custom; cf,
Greg. M„ Ep„ ix. 12 (26).
