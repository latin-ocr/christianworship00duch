380 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

In addition to these, they had to wear conspicuously a
bright-coloured pallium, as a badge of their office.1 This
pallium was a sort of scarf3 the two figures 1914 and 1915
in Saylio’s Dictionary of Antiquities exhibit the manner in
which it was worn, either over the paenula, or merely over
the tunic.

With the exception of the pallium, of which we shall
have occasion to speak later on, the dress of the Roman
clergy was absolutely identical with the dress of a
civilian of the time having some position. Pope Celestine‚
in a letter2 addressed to the Bishops of Provence, con-
demns the use of any special ecclesiastical costume‚
which is clearly a proof that none existed in his own
Church or in the countries under his immediate jurisdic-
tion.3 The documents‚ liturgical or otherwise, dealing with
the Roman use, take for granted that all ecclesiastics, from
the Pope down to an acolyte, or even beneath him wore
the planeta, or paenula, with the tunic under it. The
planeta was usually dark in hue, either brown or violet
(purpurea), while the tunic was of a light colour. 'I'his
costume was still used in the sixth century by laymen of
distinction. The biography of St. Fulgentius relates that

¹ “ Discoloribus palliis pectora contegentes conditionis suae necessitatem
ex hujusmodi agnitione testentur? This scarf is merely a curtailed form
of the pallium, or ancient mantle. Everything is possible in these kinds
of transformations. The religione os certain congregations of regular
clerks (at Mount St. Bernard, for instance, at Klosterneuburg and else-
where) still wear over their habits a linen band depending in front and
behind. It is not three inches in width. This is no other, however,
than a rochet, that is to say, a long tunic with sleeves. After this we
shall scarcely be surprised to find a mantle becoming reduced to a
scal-f.

³ The elaboration of the meaning attached to the priestly vestments
of the Old Dispensation which is found in the prayer for the ordination
of bishops (cf. supra, 360), also presupposes that at the time that prayer
was drawn up there were not any clearly defined liturgical vestments.
