250 CHRISTIAN wosssfflrz 1Ts omens AND EvoturroN.

On the Saturday in Holy Week there was no special
meeting for worship. The ceremonies of the Easter Vigil
had already been transferred in the eighth century to the
afterncon of the Saturday. At the present day they are
performed in the morning. Apart from the rites in it
which bear upon baptisma] initiation, and which shall be
described later on, this solemn Vigil was distinguished by
certain peculiarities, namely, by the blessing of the new
fire, and of the candle, and by the Mass itself, in which
certain archaic features were preserved.

A very natural symbolism led to the adoption of
these ceremonies The death of Christ, followed quickly
by His resurrection, found an expressive image in the
fire, candle‚ or lamp, which being extinguished, can be
lit again. We know what importance is still attached
in our own days to the ceremony of the new fire in the
Easter ritual of the Greek Church at Jerusalem. In the
East, however, this ceremony does not extend beyond
the Holy City. It is not found in the ordinary Byzantine
ritual.

In the West, we learn from the legend of St. Patrick
that it was customary for the Irish, as early as the sixth
century, at latest, to kindle great fires at nightfall on
Easter Eve. It appears from the correspondence between
St. Bonisace and Pope Zachariasl that these fires were
lighted not from other fires, but from fiints. They were
really new fires. This custom appears to have been
peculiar to the British or Irish, and to have been con—

veyed, through the Anglo—Saxons, to the Continent by

distance from a chureh, even after the Church was free from persecution. In
519, Dor-otheos, the Bishop of Thessalonica, fearing that persecution was
about to descend upon his flock, caused the elements for communion to be
distributed among them in basketsful, canistra plena, ne imminente perse-
cutione communicare mm possent (smel, ΕΜ). Rom. Perat„ vol. i. p. 302).
