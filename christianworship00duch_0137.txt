001106111611, it was only necessary to note the anthems‚
which gave the tone 101 the psalm, seeing that the
choristers either had a psalter in their hands, or else
knew the psalm so thoroughly by 1166113 that it was
needless to inscribe it in the antiphonary.

Antiphonal chanting of the psalms as it obtains to· -day
is executed sometimes with a rapid, and at others with a
leW‚ movement and more complicated modulatione. The
latter method is almost exclusively reserved for the antiphon
01 1116 introit, while the other is of general use in the
psalmody 01 1116 office. It is probable that at the beginning
the slow movement was that which was more generally
followed. There has been a progressive shortening 01 611
the parts 01 Divine Servioe, whether prayers, lections,
or chants, but 113 was in the category of the 01161116 that <
most of the suppressione occurred. We see this clearly in
the antiphons 01 1116 Μ666. 111 0116 01 these—the introit—
the psalm is reduced 130 6 single verse, followed by the
doxology‚ while in the antiphon ad communionem it has
entirely disappeared.

In addition to the psalms introduced between 13116
160110116 and the antiphone of the Roman Mass, the
Eucharistic service admitted other 01161116, 01 which Ι
will treat later on. All 01 1116111, with the exception of
the Sanctus, are of relatively recent date. In regard to
the Sanctus, moreover, it is necessary to distinguish
between its words and the musical rendering 01 them.
The present custom 01 reciting the seraphic hymn in
common, and aloud, goes back to the same early date as
that assigned to the general subject-matter 01 13116 preface
and 01 1116 canon. The application of melody to the words
is probably 01 16161 (1616.

recitative or intoning 01 1116 lections or such 01 the prayers
