dominum nostrum Jcsum Christum 2 The acolyte replies,
as the occasion requires, either Graece or Latine, and is
then ordered by the priest to teach the catechumena in
their proper language, the formulary of the faith.

There is no doubt that the formulary employed origin-
ally at Rome was the Apostles' Creed, which is, properly

with by St. Augustine in his explanation of this ceremony.l

Then followed the traditio of the Pater noster. The
priest himself assumed this function. He began with a
general exhortation, and then proceeded to recite clause

his recitation with a running commentary. After the last
petition there was a short address, which concluded the
ceremony.2

This simple, but very imposing, ceremony must have
produced a lively impression on the candidates for baptism.
Ι am inclined to believe that this ceremony finds artistic
expression in the representation of the giving of the Law
which we find on many early Christian monuments, such
as pictures, sarcophagi, decorated vases, and especially the

as seated on a splendid throne placed on the summit of
a mountain from whence flow the four rivers of Paradise.
Around him are assembled the apostles. St. Peter, their
chief, receives from the hands of the Saviour a book——

emblem of the Christian Law-——on which is inscribed
DOMINUS LEGEM DAT‚ or some similar device. Above

Pater noster, and are explanatory of the latter.
