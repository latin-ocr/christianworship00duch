44 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

somewhat undisciplined foundations there were, a century
later, taken in hand and reformed by St. Boniface.

Thus throughout the regions of the West, whatever the
political situation may have been, whatever the form or
degree of progress of ecclesiastical organisation‚ there
was nothing at the close of the sixth century which could
lead us to foresee that the Latin Church would one day
be more centralised than ever the Roman Empire had been.
