. But on the fiftieth day, that is, the Lord's Day, when the
people have a very great deal to go through, everything that is
customary is done from the first cockcrow onwards 3 vigil is kept
in the Anastasis, that the Bishop may read the passage from the
Gospel that is always read on the Lord's Day, namely, the
account of the Lord's Resurrection‚ and afterwards everything
customary is done in the Anastasis, just as throughout the whole
year. But when morning is come, all the people proceed to the
great church, that is, to the Martyrium, and all things usual are
done there 3 the Priests preach and then the Bishop, and all
things that are prescribed are done, the Offcring being made,
as is customary on the Lord's Day, only the same Dismissal¹
in 13110 Martyrium is hastened, in order that 113 may 100 made

before the third hour.

(b) station at Sion.

And when the Dismissal has been made at the Martyrium,
all the people, 130 a man, escort the Bishop with hymns to Syon,
so that they are in Syon when the third hour 10 fully come. And
on their arrival there the passage from the Acts of the Apostles
is read where the Spirit came down so that (men of) all tongues
understood the things that were spoken, and the Dismissal takes
place afterwards in due course. The Priests likewise (preach)
on that which is read, because this 10 13110 selfsame place in Syon
——on which the church now stands—where of old the multitude
was assembled with the Apostles after the Lord’s Passion, where
this occurred3 the account of this, as We have said above, is
there read from the Acts of 1110 Apostles Afterwards the
Dismissal takes place in due course, and the Offering is made
there. Then, that the people may 100 dismissed, the Archdeacon
raises his voice, and says: ‘⁶ Let us all be ready to-day 111
Eleona, in the Imbomon, directly after the sixth hour.''
