the see of St. Peter, a place hallowed by the apostles, became
the uncontested metropolis of the Ohurch. The Easterns
themselves, in spite of the long sojourn in their midst of the
Apostle John, recognised the fact without raising any obstacle. >
At the end of the first century, the Roman Church, by the
mouthpiece of Clement, intervened with imposing authority
in the internal conflicts of the Church of Corinth, which was,
however, equally of apostolic foundation. Hermas, shortly
after, wrote his Pastor for 611 the Churches; and Ignatius, the

of Christendom fiocked thither—heretica] doctors, orthodox
travellers, apologists, bishops, inhabitants of Asia Minor,
Syrians, people from Pontus, Palestine, and Egypt. Rome
was, in short, the visible centre of all Christian activity,
whether Oatholic or heterodOX. The great capitals, Carthage,

province of Asia alone counts for something3 but its claims
to importance were only secondary, as the conflict at the
end of the second century with regard to the keeping of
Easter clearly demonstrated.
