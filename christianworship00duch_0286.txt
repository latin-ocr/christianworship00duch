264 cunis'rIAN WORsHIP: irs omem AND EVOLUTION.

we could find it fully stated in some author} Unfortu-
nately we know of no text containing it, and we are there-
fore compelled to put it forward as an hypothesis, but it is
an hypothesis which falls in with what we may call the
recognised methods in such matters.

I will adduce, moreover, a coincidence which increases
its probability. Up to the present we have been dealing
only with the date of the 25th of December. That of the
Gth of April still remains to be explained.

Sozomen2 makes mention of a sect of the Montanists
who celebrated Easter 011 the Gth of April in place of the
25th of March, because the world having been created at
the equinox, that is, according to their reckoning, on the
24th of March, the first full moon of the first month took
place fourteen days later, that is, on the eth of April.3 Now,
between the eth of April and the eth of J anuary there are
just nine months, the same interval as between the 25th
of March and the 25th of December. The Greek day for
the observance of the N ativity, the eth of January, is thus
found to be connected with a paschal computation, based
on astronomical and symbolical consideratione exactly similar
to those from which we have endeavoured to deduce the

date of the 25th of December.
It is possible, from what has preceded, that the date

¹ It is indeed found, but at too late a date, that is, when the festival
of the Nativity had been observed for a long time. Thus St. Augustino

blames the Jews for having transgressed against the command ‘non coques
aqnzcm in lacte matris suae. The lamb is J esus Christ, crucified the 25th of
March, that is, on the same day in which His mother began to have milk:
· Dicuntur enim feminae ex quo conceperint lac colligere '⁷ (In Heptat„ ii. 90).

2 Η. Ε, vii 18.

³ This reasoning would not be conclusive for the date of the Passion,
an event separated from the Creation by an interval of some thousands of
years; but it is understood that the Passover of Christ, being the true
Passover, must fall due at typical maturity reckoned from the origin of
all things. The Passion could not possibly have taken place on the eth of
April3 for no Friday, the Gth of April, can be found in the interval of years
from which we have to choose, as coinciding with the full moon.
