THE TWO LITURGIOAL USES OF THE LATIN WEST. 87

from Rome, and that on this ground the Roman Liturgy

alone has the primordial right to be the liturgy of Latin
Christendom :——

Quis enim nesciat aut non advertat id quod a principe apostolorum Petro
Romanae ecclesiae traditum est ac nunc usque custoditur ab omnibus
debere servari, nec superduci aut introduci aliquid quod auctoritatem non
habeat, aut aliunde accipere videatur exemplum? Praesertim cum sit
manifestum in omnem Italiam, Galliam, Hispanias, Africam, atque Siciliam
insulasque interjacentes nullum instituisse ecclesias, nisi eos quos venera-
bilis apostolus Petrus aut ejus successores constituerunt sacerdotes ’ἓ Aut
legant si in his provinciis alius apostolorum invenitur aut legitur docuisse.
Quod si non legunt, quia nusquam inveniunt, oportet eos hoc sequi quod
ecclesia Romana custodit, a qua eos princip ium accepisse non dubium
est.

However strange the fact may seem to us, it is none
the less certain that, from the time of Pope Innocent, the
Roman liturgical use was not the only one followed in
the West, or even in Italy itself. The bishop to whom the
letter, from which I have just quoted, was addressed was
Bishop of Eugubium‚ in the district of Umbria, which
belonged to the metropolitan diocese of the Pope. As an
immediate suffragan of the Pope he had special reasons for
conforming to Roman customs, and notwithstanding this
he was tempted to introduce others. The practice of Rome
was thus attacked in its own domain.

The letter belongs to the year 416. The liturgical
and disciplina] peculiarities which were therein found to
be opposed to the Roman customs are all characteristic of

the documents which have come down to us bearing on this ancient
Christian community agree in representing it as being in close and
frequent relations with the Ohurch of Rome. There is nothing to prove
that its founder was from the Province of Asia, rather than a Roman.
Supposing even that he was an Asiatic, it was possibly the case that

he had lived in the first instance at Rome, and had there received his
mission.
