278 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

of the natalis and of the depositio of each bishop—
anniversaries which the Popes, at least, were accustomed
to commemorate, and that, too, as early as the first half
of the fourth century. The choice of the day was not
suggested by any Christian tradition. The reason will
be clear if we glance at the ancient calendars of pagan
Rome,1 wherein we see that the 22nd of February was
devoted to the celebration of a festival, popular above
all others, in memory of the dead of each family. The
observance of this festival and the participation in its
ceremonies were considered as a thing incompatible with
the profession of a Christian 3 but it was very difficult to
uproot such ancient and cherished habits. It was, doubt-
less, to meet this difficulty that the Christian festival of
the 22nd of February was instituted.

This festival was of more special interest to the
Church of Rome than to others. Hence we see that
it was never adopted in the East. It has not left,
moreover‚ any trace in Africa.2 In Gaul, however, it is
found at a somewhat early date. As early as 448 it is
mentioned in the Calendar of Polemius Silvius.3 Several
homilies bear testimony to its existence and to its identi-
fication with the festival of the Cara Goyncatz'oss The
Council of Tours of the year 567 ⁵ is also a witness
to it. From these authorities we may gather how difficult
it must have been to suppress the ancient funeral repast
of the 22nd of February. This funeral repast was observed

⁵ Can. 22: “Sunt etiam qui in festivitate cathedrae domni Petri
apostoli cibos mortuis offerunt, et post missas redeuntes ad domos proprias
ad gentilium revertuntur errores, et post corpus Domini sacratas daemoni
escas accipiunt.⁷'
