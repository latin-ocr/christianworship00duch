a church without relies in its altar. When relies (pty-

Formularies for the dedication of churches are not
found in either the Leonian Sacramentary or that of
Adrian.2 The Gelasian Sacramentary‚ as is always the

whether it corresponds in this respect with Roman or
Gallican usage, or whether it is a mixture of the two.
The same may be said of the liturgical works of Frankish
origin from the eighth century onwards. There is, more-

naturally arises whether the whole of the dedication
formulary was fixed when they were copied. There must
have still been a wide latitude in this respect.

If we carry our researches further back than the eighth
century, we find the earliest authority for Roman usage
to be the letter from Pope Vigilius to Profuturus of Eraga

English Council of Celichyth [Chelsea—TR.]‚ held in 816, 0. 2:
“Eucharistia . . . cum aliis reliquiis condatur in capsula ac servetur in
eadem basilica. Et si alias reliquias intimare non potest, tamen hoc maxime
proficere potest, quia corpus et sanguis est domini nostri J esu Christi.''

formularies peculiar to the dedication itseIf, which must have taken place

before the Mass,
