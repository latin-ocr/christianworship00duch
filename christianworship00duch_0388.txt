4. Ordiozation of the Pope.

The ceremonia] followed in the consecration of the Pope
was not much more complex, but it had some special
features. The ceremony‚ as in the case of bishops, took
place on a Sunday, but always in St. Peter's‚ where Roman 1
deacons and priests were ordained. It was a matter of ¹
obligation that all the higher clergy os Rome should
receive ordination in the sanctuary of the apostle himself.1
The elected bishop2 put on, in the secretarium, the papal
liturgical vestments‚ with the exception of the pallium.
At the chanting of the Introit he proceeded to the altar
and prostrated himself as usual before it. But instead
of rising immediately and proceeding to his throne, he
remained prostrate all the 1311110 1110 Litany was being
sung. After the Litany 110 partly raised himself while
the Bishops of Albano, Porto, and Ostia respectively
recited over him three prayers‚ of which the last was a
eucharistie prayer. During the saying of the latter by
the Bishop of Ostia, certain deacons held over the head
of the ordinand an open book of the Gospels. The bene-
diction having come to an end, the archdeacon placed the

but the words in it, excepta ecclesia, Romana, were added by Ferrandus
himself, and are indicative of the usage in the sixth century.

1 The choice of the Vatican basilica was not, however, primitive. We
can gather from the documents dealing with the ordination of Popes
Damasus, Boniface Ι., and Bonifaee 11„ that the Lateran basilica, in the
time of the Christian emperors and Gothic kings, was the locus leqitimu3‚
at least in the case of the Pope. The privilege of St. Peter's dates no

further back than Byzantine times.
² He was always a deacon or priest of Rome, but preferably the former.

Prior to 1110 last years of the ninth century, no bishop was promoted to
the papacy. The disorders and controversies occasioned by the election
of Formosa, Bishop of Porto, to the papaey, are well known. In the tenth
century there were frequent breaches of the ancient rule, and from this
time forward it ceased to be considered as obligatory.
