books in which the Roman and Gallican rituals are more
or less combined.

An ancient commentary 011 the ritual of a dedication,
published in the first instance by Martene, was attributed
by him to Remigius of Auxerre, the head of the Episcopal
School at Rheims at the end of the ninth century. Although
this attribution is not certain, the text to which the com-
mentary is attached was assuredly in use in the ninth
century, for it 13 found, almost word for word, in another
Ordo, that of the Verona manuscript, of which Ι have spoken
above.¹ It immediately precedes there the Roman ritual
which Ι 110νο just described.

The Sacramentary of Angouleme2 of the end of the
eighth or beginning of the ninth century contains, in regard
to the dedication of churches‚ an Ordo fundamentally similar
to the ritual of Remigius. It differs from it in only one
important point, to which I will shortly refer. The prayers
and other formularies contained in this Sacramentary and
in that os Gellona, which 13 of nearly the same date‚3 are
the same as those of which the ritual of Remigius furnishes
the series and the first words.

Finally, the two ancient manuscripts, called respectively
the Gelasian Sacramentary and the Missale Francorum,
contain the maj0rity of these prayers, and even some
rubrics which are absolutely identical with those implied
or expressed in the Remigius ritual and the Ordo of
Verona. We may therefore conclude that the whole of

Milanese Pontifieal of the ninth century, and from a Maintz Pontifical a
little less ancient (Mon. Lit. Ambr„ vol. i.). The Ordo Ambrosianus, pub-
lished by the Rev. Father Meroati (studi e Testi, part 7, p. 21), from a Lucca
manuscript of the eleventh century, gives indications, like the present
Pontifical, of having been rehandled.
