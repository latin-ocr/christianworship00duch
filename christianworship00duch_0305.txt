THE CHRISTIAN FEsT1VALs. 281

This festival was peculiar to Rome, and was never

imported into the East,1 or into the countries of the Gallican
rite. It is certain that it was intended to commemorate

the dedication os the basilica on the Esquiline. This dedi-
cation, therefore, had taken place on the lst of August. As
the lst of August, from the time of Augustus, was a day of
pagan religious observance and rejoicing‚2 it is possible that
it was designedly chosen.

The special festival of St. Paul (January 25) was of
much less importance than those just mentioned. In the
Auxerre recension of the Hieronymian Martyrology it is
called Translatio S. Pauli Apostoli, without any indica-
tion as to where this translation had taken place. In the
Missalc Gothicum there is a mass in Oomcrsione S. Pauli,
which appears to have been assigned to the same dato.⁸
In the ancient Roman books there is absolutely no mention
of this festival.4

The festival of St. John the Evangelist (May 6> must
have been the anniversary of the dedication of the church
near the Porta Latina, which had been consecrated in his
honour. This church is mentioned for the first time in
the Liber Pontificalis, in the passage dealing with Pope
Adrian Ι. (772-795).⁵ The festival of St. John ante
Portam Latinam has no earlier testimony than the Sacra-
mentary of the same Pope. We ought, however, to take noto
of the fact that the Greeks celebrate on the Sth of May⁶

¹ In the East there are festivals in honour of tho chains of St. Potor,
or of the dcliveranco of St. Peter (Acts xii.), but they have no connection
with the Roman festival under consideration.

² Tho vulgar still observo at Rome the day of the felice Aqoeto.

³ Cf. p. 279, note 2.

⁴ We must bear in mind, however, that tho Roman mass for Sexagosimn
Sunday is really a mass in honour of St. Paul. Tho station was hold 011
that day in the basilica of this apostlo on the Ostian Way. Thero aro
sermons of St. Augustino on the Con-version of St. Paul, but wo must
not concludo from this that tho festival existed in his timo.
