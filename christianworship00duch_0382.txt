At the invitation of the Pope, the whole congregation
prostrated themselves, including the Pope himself, the
candidates, and the clergy, while the schola cantorum sang
the Litany. When this was ended, the Pope arose, and,
placing his hands on the head of each of the candidates,
recited a double form of prayer, consisting of an ordinary
prayer and a consecratory canon1 (eucharistia prayer), as
follows :—

Deus,2 conlator sacrarum magnifice dignitatum, quaesumus, ut hos
famulos tuos quos ad officium levitarum vocare dignaris, altaris sancti
ministerium tribuas sufficienter implere, cunctisque donis gratiae redun-
dantes et fiduciam sibi tuae majestatis acquirere et aliis praebere facias
perfectae devotionis exemplum.

Vere dignum. . . . Adesto3 quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, honorum
dator, ordinum distributor officiorumque dispositor. Qui in te manens
innovas omnia, et cuncta disponens per Verbum, Virtutem Sapienti-
amque tuam, J esum Christum, Filium tuum, dominum nostrum, sempi-
terna providentia praeparas et singulis quibusque temporibus aptanda
dispensas. Cujus corpus Ecclesiam tuam caelestium gratiarum varietate
distinctam, suorumque connexam distinctione membrorum, per legem
totius mirabilem compagis unitam, in augmentum templi tui crescere
dilatarique largiris, sacri muneris servitutem trinis gradibus ministrorum
nomini tuo militare constituens3 electis ab initio Levi filiis qui mysticis
operationibus domus tuae fidelibus excubiis permanentes, haereditatem
benedictionis aeternae sorte perpetua possiderent. Super hos quoque

describing the cursus honorum of the Popes chosen from among the cardinal
priests, never make mention of the diaconate, but pass always from

¹ This prayer must have been considered as the end of the collective
prayer, which was said after the invitatory Oramus, dilectissimi. The prayer,
which was usually offered up in silence by the congregation (see above,
p. 107), was here replaced by the Litany.

² This formulary is peculiar to the Leonian Sacramentary. Ι have
corrected the consolator of the manuscript into conlator.

⁸ This formulary is common tc the three Sacramentaries.
