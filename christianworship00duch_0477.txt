a day to go to church for prayer 2 ’⁹ To Which the saint
replies, that it is possible to pray in private, wherever one
may be. His wordS, however, testify to the fact, as do
those of many other contemporary writers, that the offices
were said daily in the churches, at the canonical hours,
in the presence of the clergy and under their direction.
This is the important point. Having once found a place
in the church, private prayer was thenceforth to be retained
in it. The isolated asceticS, and the virgins living in
the world, soon disappeared or became attached to the
monasteries, in the oratories of which the occupants
performed their offices. The habit, however, had been
formed. The faithful, although not attending them, felt it
was right that the offices should be said by the clergy in
their churches, and the clergy themselves were obliged
to agree to the continuation of a practice, the regular per-
formance of which was somewhat onerous, all the more
so because in early times it had not been obligatory. The

obligation to say the offices, like the duty of celibacy, was
a legacy left to the clergy by asceticism. We might
almost say that, on these two points, a sort of tacit

by the “perfect,'' the continentes, the “men of Orod? as
they were called, had been, and continued to be, so
great, that the right of the clergy to direct the Christian
communities might have been called into question, had not
the latter hastened to adopt, in its main features, the
curriculum of the monks, and thus stopped short in a
decisive and visible manner in the downward path of
general relaxation.

Thus was laid upon the clergy the obligation of saying
the canonical offices, both day and night, in the public
churches, in the cathedrals of the towns, and the parish
churches of the country. Great variety, however, existed
in the precise arrangement of these offioes,-—in the distribution
