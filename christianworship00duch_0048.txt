28 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

In this way the great ecclesiastical areas of the East
were defined, from the middle of the fifth century onwards,
viZ. the patriarchates of Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem,
and Alexandria, with the autonomous province of the island

of Cyprus.

Outside the patriarchates and beyond the frontiers of the
Empire there still existed the national Ohurches of Ethiopia,
Persia, and Armenia. These Churches‚ founded respectively
by those of Alexandria, Antioch, and Gaesarea in Cappadocia,
were looked upon as subject to these great sees. That of
Ethiopia did not date back farther than the time of St.
Athanasius. Its metropolitan, whose seat was at first at
Axum, was, and still is, ordained by the Patriarch of
Alexandria.l

The Church of Persia, far more ancient than the above,
had been in existence as early as the close of the second
century. Barely tolerated by the Parthian kings, it was
often persecuted under the sassanids. Its ruler resided
at Seleucia. When, towards the close of the fifth century,
the Nestorians were proscribed, and banished from the
Empire, they took refuge beyond the Persian frontier‚ and
Nestorianism, introduced by them, became, after a fashion‚
the national religion of the Christians of the Sassanid
kingdom. This circumstance afforded them increased
security, and they availed themselves of their position to
found in Malabar, and even in distant China, Churches
which exist, or of which traces are preserved, even to the
present day.

Christianity was introduced into independent Armenia
towards the beginning of the fourth century. N ational
tradition makes St. Gregory the Illuminator the first apostle

Justinian. It, too, occupied the position of suffragan to Alexandria. See
