I will quote also a formulary for the reciting of the
diptychs according to the use of an Irish Chureh. It is
to be found in the Stowe Missal, inserted in the middle
of the Memento of the dead used in the Roman Mass.³

Oum4 omnibus in toto mundo offerentibus sacrificium spiritale Deo
Patri et Filio et Spiritui sancto sanetis ac venerabilibus sacerdotibus,

ut nomen domni Papae quicumque sedi apostolicae praefuerit, in nostris
ecclesiis recitetur.'’

¹ The words {florio-<cce . . . infantum must have beenalater addition. They
are not provided for in the formulary which goes before: apostolorum et
martyrum. The names of the martyrs have disappeared.

² This formulary must differ widely from its primitive text. It has,
nevertheless, preserved certain vestiges of antiquity, notably the grouping
of the holy confessors with the ordinary dead. Mabillon compares it with
the commemorative formulary, which appears at the end of the Rule of
Aurelian, Bishop of Arles, of the sixth century (Migne, Pet. Lat.2 vol. lxviii.
. 395).
p ³ Warren, loc. cit.9 pp. 237, 240. The formulary is interrupted by a.
litany and a prayer of which we need not take account. These pieces
occupy two intercalated leaves (29, 30) (Warren, p. 200), in a later hand-
writing. The names in the Litany, both Latin and Irish, are all in the
vocative, and are preceded by the word Sancte, and followed by Ora pro
nobis. In the primitive list—the only one which I cite here—the Latin
and Irish names are all isolated, and in the genitive case, as the construction

of the sentence requires.
⁴ I have restored the usual orthography for the ordinary text. but not

for the proper names,
