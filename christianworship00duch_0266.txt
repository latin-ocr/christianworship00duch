from the observance of fasting. The fast in both places,
therefore, lasted in reality only thirty-six days. There
were, moreover, Churches in which, up to the fifth
century, Lent consisted of only three weeks of fasting.
These, whether broken up by intervals or not, always
occurred in the sacred period of six or seven weeks.¹
About the middle of the fifth century the greater number
of divergences had disappeared3 the two usages of Rome-
Alexandria and Antioch-Constantinople had absorbed all
others into their respective domainS, and taken definite
shapes.

Certain supplemental days came, however, to be added.
The thirty-six days of actual fasting seemed at first to
form a perfect number, that of the tenth of the whole
year.2 The inconsistency of this period with the name
of Quadragesima‚ however, came to be noted. The author
at Rome of the Liber Pontzficalis sought to enforce, even
in his time, the necessity of a seventh week, which
would, according to the Roman usage, have increased
the number of fasting-days to sorny-two. ln the seventh
century3 four days were added, by what Pope we cannot
say, and from that time forward these have been universally
accepted throughout the West. It was about this time
also that the stational Masses for the three Sundays in

period of forty days had been at first introduced for another purpose than
that of fastfflg, and that it was only by a sort of continuous expansion
that the fast succeeded in extending itself over the whole Quadragesima.

³ St. Gregory in his time knows of only the thirty-six days (Hom. 16

in Erana). The Gelasian Sacramentary drawn up at the beginning of
the eighth century has already the stational Masses for the supplementary

days
