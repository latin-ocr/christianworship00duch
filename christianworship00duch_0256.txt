234 CHRISTIAN wonsHIP: 1Ts omem AND EVOLUTION.

ξ 3.-ΗΟΙΧ WEEK.

Similar observations may be made on the subject of Holy
Week. The most ancient of its peculiar features is the
festival of Maundy Thursday, devoted to the solemn com-
memoration of the institution of the Eucharist‚ to which was
added, at all events at Rome, the consecration of holy oils
and the reconciliation of penitents‚ ceremonias which invest
it with the character of an immediate preparation for the
Christian Easter. With the exception of the Thursday,
there are no ancient Stations in Holy Week except those
of the Wednesday and Friday. Saturday never had, and
even now has not, any Station assigned it, properly speaking,
since the present service for that day is merely the Easter
Vigil anticipated. The liturgical Stations for Monday and
Tuesday are certainly later than the time of St. Leo. It
was, in fact, the custom of this Pope to give a yearly
exposition on the Passion of our Lord, and as it was im-
possible for him to do so in one sermon, he began on the
Sunday before Easter, and continued his exposition at the
Station on Wednesday. Had there been any meetings
between the Sunday and the VVednesday, St. Leo would
not have waited till the latter day to resume his discourse.
In the present service for Good Friday‚ if we except the
ceremonies connected with the Adoration of the Cross,
which are certainly not an essential part of it, and also the
Mass of the Presanctified, we have the exact order of the
ancient Synaxes without a liturgy‚ namely, lections alter-
nating with chants, and followed by prayers for all the
necessities of the Church. The lections are still three in
number, separated by two psalm ‘responsorii in the form of
the gradual and the tract.

I am inclined to believe that the ancient service for
Wednesday in Holy WVeek was of exactly the same type,
