text was furnished by the Psalter. A less essential but
widely used exercise was the homily (Midrash) on a theme
supplied by the lections.

These four elements—lections, chants, homilies‚ and
prayers—were adopted without hesitation by the Christian
ChurcheS. There was soon to be found on the reader's desk,
in addition to the books of the J ewish Bible, the writings of
the New Testament, among which a special prominence was
given to the Gospel. This was all the change, with the
exception, of course, of such modifications as were neces-
sitated, by the new direction given to saith, in the text of
prayers and homilies, as well as in the choice of the biblical
lessons and sacred canticles.

But if the Church took over en bloc all the religious
service of the synagogue, it added thereto one or two new
elements‚ which constituted that which was original in the
Christian Liturgy. I refer to the Supper, or sacred repast,
and the spiritual exercises.

These both occupied a very high place in the Christian
service, such as we see it in the earliest documents. After
the Eucharist, certain inspired persons began to preach and
to make manifest before the assembly the presence of the
spirit which animated them. The prophets, the ecstatics, the
speakers in tongues, the interpreters, the supernatural healers,
absorbed at this time the attention of the faithful. There
was, as it were, a Liturgy of the Holy Ghost after the Liturgy
of Christ, a true liturgy with a Real Presence and com-
munion. The inspiration could be felt-it sent a thrill
through the organs of certain privileged persons, but the
whole assembly was moved, edified, and even more or less
ravished by it and transported into the Divine sphere of the
Paraclete.l
