and the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius (28-29). As
for the month and the day, Clement of Alexandrial speaks
of calculations which result in fixing these as the 18th or
19th of April, or even as the 29th of May. But these were
private calculations upon which no festival observance could
be made to depend. The book called De Pascha Oomputus,
put forth in 243, either in Africa or in Italy, states that our
Lord was born on the 28th of March.2 Those who proposed
such figures evidently knew nothing of the existence of the
festival of the Nativity. At Rome, however, Hippolytus,
at the beginning of the third century, fixes, in his Commen-
tary on Daniel (iv. 9), the'f date as Wednesday, the 25th of
December, in the forty-second year of the Emperor Augustus3
We have no reason as yet, however, to conclude from this
that the festival of the Nativity had been already instituted

in the time of St. Hippolytus.
The most ancient authority for the observance of the

N ativity is the Philocalian Calendar, drawn up at Rome in
the year 336. We read in it, in the table called Depositio
stscm‘tyrum: viii. kal. jan„ ‘natus Christus in Betleam Judee.
The table of episcopal anniversarics, moreover, implies that
the beginning of the liturgical year was between the 8th and

27th of December.4

Christmas was originally a festival peculiar to the Latin
Church. St. John Chrysostom states, in a homily delivered
in 386, that it had not been introduced into Antioch until
about ten years before, that is, about 3755 At this time

yet alive. The first year of J esus began, on this hypothesis, in the year
2 or 1 before our era (752-753 A.U.c.), whilst Herod died in the spring of
the fourth year before A.D. (⁴5ss. 750 A.U.c.).
