12. Brz'tz'sh and Irish Boffs, eto.

The ancient liturgical manuscripts found in the British
Isles are aH, with one 01· two exceptions, books of a mixed
character—in the main Roman, but with certain Gallican
details. The most important is the Stowe Missal,1 which
contains, at the end of St. John’s Gospel, an ordinary [and
Canon] of the Mass,2 followed by prayers belonging to three
Masses for special occasions, an Ordo Baptztsmi, an Ordo aaz
infirmum visitandum, and finally a treatise in Irish on the cere-
monies of the Mass. All are not in the same handwriting.
The Latin texts are partly of the eighth and partly of the
tenth century. N early all the rubrics are in the later hand,
in which also are many additions in the blank spaces left
in the original text, and even. over the lines, which have
been previously erased. The beginning of the Canon is
in the later wriffing, as is also the rubric- Canon dominicus
papae Gilasvg to which too much confidence should not
be given. We have here, in fact, the usual Roman
Canon in its Gregorian form, that is to say, with the
final diesque nostros, etc„ in the Home igitur. There are,
however, interpolations in various places, sometimes in
the earlier, sometimes in the later hand. Among these
interpolations‚ one of the most curicus is that of the
Memento sor the departed (in the earlier hand); we find

Gallicanus The fourth Council of Toledo (o. 25) decreed that bishops
should fumish every priest to whom they entrusted the care of a parish,

with a libellus officialis to direct them in performing the ceremonies con-
nected with public worship. No book of this nature has come down to us.

Stowe Missal, Calc-utta, 1881.

'⁹' This Mass, when due allowance is made for the long interpolationis from
Irish sources, presents a srriking resemblance in general outline to the Missa
quotidiana Romensis of the Bobbio Missal, with which we shall presently
have to deal. Attention has been drawn to this similarity by Dom Cagin
in Pale‘oyraphz’e Musz'cale, vol. v. p. 128.
