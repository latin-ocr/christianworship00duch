He then received a white garment, which the bishop
handed to him, saying—

must have taken place. The bishop, having his 101115
girt, washed the feet of the neophytes, saying to each
of them-—

Ego tibi lavo pedes, sicut dominus noster Jesus Christus fecit
discipulis suis, ut tu facias hospitibus et peregrinis, ut habeas vitam
aeternam.³

The ceremony of the feet-washing was obser-ved in
Gaul and at Milan, but not in Spain, where it had been
officially proscribed by the Councss of Elvira.4 We find
no traces of it in the East, and it is quite certain that it

Sacramentary. The Missale Gallicanum omits this ceremony.

² Before, according to the Missale Gothicum; after, according to the
Bobbio Sacramentary.

⁸ Text of the Missale Gothicum. The words in the other Sacramentaries
have nearly the same import. St. Caesarius (Serm. 160, De temp.) implies
an identical formulary. The same may be said of St. Maximus of Turin
(De Bapt„ tract. 3).
