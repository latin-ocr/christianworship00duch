378 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

Hence the obligation of having three bishops for a con-
secration to the episcopate, an obligation universally accepted
from the beginning of the fourth century, except where a
consecrator sufficiently qualified to represent in himself
the collective episcopate is in question.1

Besides this intervention of three bishops at the least,
episcopal ordination was characterised‚ with the same uni-
versality‚ by the ceremony of the open book of the Gospels
being placed on the head of the candidate.2 This rite, which
was already widely observed in the fourth century, cannot
have been altogether primitive, but it is certainly very ancient,

The anointing peculiar to the Gallican rite must have
been suggested by the Old Testament, where we have
frequent mention of the anointing of priests. It would
seem not to have been very ancient. Certain indications
would lead us to look for its origin in the Ghurches of
Britain,3 where it was practised as early as the sixth century.

It was about this period, or rather shortly after it, that
the traditio of liturgical vestments and other similar insignia
began to take their place among the ceremonies of ordina-
tion. 1 have passed over in silence up to the present the
indications furnished on this subject in the Roman Ordines
and other ritual authorities. This seems the proper moment
to discuss the matter.

¹ This is the case of the Pope. I should not be astonished if it were
found that a similar usage existed in Alexandrum but I have no proof of
it. The Patriarch of Alexandria, like the Pope, was the only bishop in
his province at whose ordination the rite of the imposition of the Gospel
was used.

² See, however, the restrictions pointed out in the preceding note.
These departures, however, do not attain the same universality as the
observance of the rite.

³ Gildas is the earliest author who mentions it. The Statum know
nothing of it. The same is the case, I believe, with the Frankish writers
of the sixth century, and the Spanish up to Isidore inclusive. It was
always more widely practised in Great Britain than elsewhere. Of. above,
