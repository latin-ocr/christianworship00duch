123A CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

assembly. In addition to the Masses for these holy days,
it provides no others, except for the day of a dedication
festival, for the ordination of a Pope or Priest Cardinal,
for a marriage, or the obsequies of a Pope. It furnishes
no ritual for a dedication, nor any Mass for Sundays and
ordinary days, or for the funerals of clergy or laity. There
are no Masses for special needs, such as in time of war,
pestilence, tempests, and other visitations3 nor for the sick,
fishermen, travellers, and so forth. We do not even find in
it the formularies1 connected with the velatio viminum and
the reconciliation of penitents.

Ι should therefore hesitate to consider this selection as
a complete book, sufficient for all liturgical necessities‚ even
in the time of Adrian. It may possibly have been a copy
for the Pope’s special use, for it contains, indeed, the prayers
which he would be called upon to recite during most of
the ceremonies at which he usually presided. It may have
been a book with a less restricted use, but in such a case
it would be necessary to conclude that it was considerably
supplemented by other texts. A priest of Rome, if he were
limited to this book, would not have been able to bury
one of his parishioners, or officiate on ordinary Sundays,
or observe the festival even of any Roman saint outside
the very small number who figure in the Liber Sacra-
mentorum. The strongest proof of its inadequacy is the fact
that when at length it reached France, it was recognised
as defective for use, and had to be provided with con-
siderable supplements.

Hence it is a grave mistake to regard it as having been
the only Missal in use in the Roman Ghurch at any given

¹ The short prayers Super penitentem, ad diaconam faciendam, ad
ancillas Dei velandas, which figure (Muratori, vol. ii., pp. 265, 266) in
Adrian’s Sacramentary, cannot be considered as equivalent to the formularies
used on these occasions.
