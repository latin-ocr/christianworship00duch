Roman 01101010, better observed at Rome than elsewhere,
100011100 was had to legends without any foundation.l

As to the mitre, we have no reason to treat of it here,
as it does not oome into question till the eleventh century.
Indeed, neither in the eleventh century nor at the present
time canit be said to constitute an episcopal sign of office,

properly speaking.

The traditio of vestments 01 00010010011001 insignia had
its place in the ritual of ordination. The texts of St. Isidore
and of the fourth Counoil of Toledo, cited above, make
express mention of it, but do not state at what moment in
the ceremony it took place. The other doouments of the
Gallioan ritual are silent 011 11110 point. In 1110 Roman
Ordines of the eleventh century we find the arohdeaoon
0101111οἓΓ 1110 candidates in the Vestments of the order about
to be conferred on them, and presenting them 10 1110 Pope
thus apparelled to receive the blessing for the diaconate, 1110
priesthood, 01 1110 episeopaoy. This ceremony took place in
front of the altar, in the special 0001001110, 01 presbyterium,
beyond the apse, where the pontiff, surrounded by the higher
olergy, was enthroned. The vestments thus solemnly 000-
ferred were—the orarium with the dalmatio for deaoons,
and the planeta for priests. Bishops were invested with
both dalmatio and planeta, the latter being worn over the

former.

¹ The story, for instance, of 1110 staff of st. Peter, which was oonfided 1ο a
missionary bishop‚ that he might restore life to one of his eompanions who
had died 00 1110 journey. Innocent III. (De ΑΗ. Mys-t„ i. 62) is the first to
have given this explanation. He connects it with the legend of St.
Eucherius of Treves. At the time that he wrote, the same story was related

about several other saints.
