PILGRIMAGE or ETHERIA (summ), 557

Anastasis is before sunrise. For their sake the Dismissal is in
the morning, as I said 3 not that they alone communicate, but all
who are so minded communicate on that day in the Anastasis.

5. The Fast.

This is the oustom of the fast 111 Quadragesima : some, when
they have eaten after the Dismissal on the Lord's Day, that is,
about the fifth or sixth hour, do not eat throughout the whole
week until after the Dismissal at the Anastasis on the Sabbathg
these are they who keep the week's (fast).

Nor, after having eaten in the morning, do they eat in the
evening of the sabbath, but they take a meal on the next day,
that 15, 011 the Lord's Day, after the Dismissal from the chureh
at the fifth hour or later, and then they do not eat again until
the Sabbath comes round, 35 Ι 53101 above. For the custom here
is that all who are Azmtacfflm, as they call them here, whether
men or women, eat only 01100 3 day on the day when they do eat,
not only in Quadragesima, but throughout the whole year. But
if any of the Apatactitae cannot keep the entire week of fasting
as described above, they take a meal in the middle (of the week),
on the fifth day, all through Quadragesima. And if any one
cannot do this, he keeps two days' fast (in the week) all through
Quadragesima, and they who cannot do even this, take a meal
every evening. For no one exacts from any how much he should
do, but each does what he can, nor is he praised who has done
much, nor is he blamed who has done less 3 that is the custom
here. For their food during the days of Quadragesima is 35
follows :—-they taste neither bread which cannot be weighed,1 nor
oil, nor anything that grows on trees, but only water and a little
gruel made of flour. Quadragesima is kept thus, as we have
said. And at the end of the week's (fast) the vigil is kept in the
Anastasis from the hour of lucernam on the sixth weekday‚ when
the people come with psalms from Syon, to the morning of the
Sabbath, when the Oblation is offered in the Anastasis. And
the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth weeks in Quadragesima

are kept as the first.
