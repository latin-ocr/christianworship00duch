and as it was customary to observe the prescription, dum
missarum solemnia pcrayuntur, altare sine sacrificio non

to maintain this idea 61 permanence.

It was a matter 61 importance in the Roman Church
that the ritual 61 1116 Communion should contain a clear
and striking expression 61 ecclesiastical unity. Hence

Pope also took part in it, but only through his inter-
