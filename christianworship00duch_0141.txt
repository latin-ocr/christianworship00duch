Boosss or THE LATIN RITE. 121

copies were made of the Gregorian Sacramentary‚ and
apparently all the Churches were obliged to make it the
basis of their liturgical use. A considerable number of the
copies executed under Charlemagne and his immediate
successore have been preserved till the present time.
Monsieur L. Delisle has drawn up a catalogue1 of them,
which will, no doubt, be rendered more complete by further
researches, but which is sufficient to give an idea of the
rapid propagation of the Gregorian text.

The Sacramentary sent by Pope Adrian was, however,
far from containing all the necessary details and formu-
laries. In transcribing it, it was rendered more complete.
In some of the manuscripts? its text from one end to the
other was combined with the Roman Sacramentary which
had been in previous use. In others—and these are the
most numerous—the copyist merely inserted, as an appendix
to the Gregorian text, the supplementary matter which
he considered needful. Ι doubt whether such a thing
exists as a pure Gregorian text without interpolations or
additions of any kind.

But this is of little moment, since in the large number
of copies in which the Gregorian text is followed by
supplements, these latter are separated from it in a very
distinct manner, and it is perfectly easy to isolate them.
The author of the supplemented edition has been careful
to inform us what were the contents of the Sacramentary
properly so called, and the nature of the additions

sieur Delisle’s catalogue comprises all the Latin Sacramentaries without
distinction, but the copies of the Gregorian Sacramentary are by far the
most numerous

² For instance, the Sacramentaries of Gellona and of Angouleme (Paris,
12048, 816; cf. Deliele, op. cit„ pp. 80, 91), and that of S. Re'mi of Rheims
(Delisle, p. 87), now lost, but known through a modern copy (U. Chevalier,
Bibliotheque Zitur9³111⁶e, vol. vii., pp. ele-357).
