EGCLESIASTIGAL AREAs. 3

It was not only, however, into the cities of recent
foundation that Jewish colonies were introduced3 we find
them, and that at an early date, in the Greek cities of the
AEgean. There again they played a part amongst the
“instruments of government '² according to the custom of
the Macedonian dynasties. Into the midst of this restless
population‚ stirred periodically by the remembrance of their
ancient freedom‚ the Jews imported an element of order and
loyalty to the established rule.

Once founded, these Jewish colonies developed rapidly,
both by the natural increase of population‚ and the sponta-

as well as by proselytism. Proselytism was favoured at this
particular moment by the decay of religione belief throughout
the whole of Greece. Jewish ideas with regard to the
divinity, even if they differed widely from the polytheism
of the people, were not opposed to the tenets of the Greek

classes. In that period of servility, the better spirits within
the recently founded cities where the Greek decadence
was unhappily allied to the old corruption of the East,
might by a moral reaction be attracted towards Judaism.

history which might have offended the aesthetic sense of the
Greek, and presented them in such a philosophie form as
fell in with the fashion of the time. Philo of Alexandria
was the most celebrated writer of this school. The principa}
q obstacle to this kind of propaganda was the difficulty of con-
version without a change of nationality. However diluted
the ‹Iudaism of Philo might be, it still remained a religion
