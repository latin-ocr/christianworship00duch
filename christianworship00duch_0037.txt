ECCLESIASTICAL AREAS. 17

There was thus a metropolis without as yet a metro-
politan. Such was the case, for example, in the Church

at Antioch.
When such inter-relations were represented by the

episcopate with its hierarchical staff, these are found to
correspond with tolerable exactness to certain institutions
of the Empire. We may compare the Bishops of Carthage‚
Alexandria, and Antioch to the Proconsul of Africa, to the
Prefect of Egypt, and to the Legate of Syria respectively‚
but it is certain that there was no imitation intended.
The forms of civil government in question arose out of
geographical exigencies and from certain historical relations

’ resulting from these exigencies. It was the same with the

Christian primacies. The Bishop of Carthage became the
chief of the African bishops‚ because it was from the Church
of Carthage that the founders of the Churches of Africa had
gone forth, and their starting out from that city was con-
ditioned by the geographical disposition of the country which
had made Carthage a natural centre. The same may be
said of other natural metropolitan sees, which are the most
ancient of all.

Beyond this, however, there is no farther resemblance,
during the period anterior to the end of the third century,
between the areas of the metropolitan sees of the Ohurch
and the provincial divisions of the Empire. What
little we know of the councils held in those early times
is sufficient to prove that there was 110 attempt to
group the Churches according to the divisions of the civil
provinces

These councils, the earliest of which date back to the
later years of the second century, constitute a very re-
markable revelation of ecclesiastical inter-diocesan relations.
At the time that Tertullian wrote his De quwniis (cir. 220)
they were unknown in Africa ; in the Greek-speaking coun-
tries‚ on the contrary, they were already an established
