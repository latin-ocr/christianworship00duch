ΤΠΕ TWO LITURGIGAL USES OF THE LATIN WEST. 91.

Treves, Vienne, and Arles had passed away. The Bishop of
Lyons, whatever may have been his importance in the second
century, occupied no special prominence after Constantine.
He was scarcely more than metropolitan of Lufflunensis
Prima until the time of Gregory VII„ who was the founder
of the primacy of Lyons, ineffective as it was. It was
not in conditions such as these that this Ohurch could
become the model of all Western Churches‚ the focus of an
ecclesiastical radiation sufficiently intense to make itself felt
beyond the Pyrenees and the English Channel, and, crossing
the Alps, strong enough to withdraw from the area of Roman
influence half the Churches of Italy.1

It is manifest that another solution of the question must
be sought for. The solution I have to offer is based on 1116
assumption that Milan was the principal centre of this
development.2

I have shown above that the Church of Milan had been,

¹ I am well acquainted with the fact that, towards the end of the
sixth century, the Bishop of Lyons seems 10 have put forward a claim to
supremacy over the Bishops of Gontran⁷s kingdom. Gregory of Tours
(Hist. Franc, v. 20) gives the title of patriarch to St. Nizier. His
successor, Priscus, bears the same designation in the national couneil of
585. He even brings about the decision there that the 1161101161 councils
shall be held every three years, he and the king eonvoking them. The
Bishop of Lyons is the first to sign in the councils of Paris (614), Clichy
(627), and of Chalon-sur-Saene (about 650). In the years 597 and 692 he
consecratcs the Archbishop of Oanterbury. Of. my Fastes E'piscopaux de
Z’Ancierme Gaule, vol. i. p. 138. But this state of affairs has no sort of
relation 10 11161 which obtained at the beginning, in the time of Pothinus
and Irenaeus. The history of St. Avitus of Vienne and that of the Vicariat
of Arles are sufficient to prove this.

² We might, in this connection, think of Arles, which enjoycd such
a very high ecclesiastica] position in the fifth and sixth centuries. But
this position was attained 100 1616. It was 10 1116 fourth, and not to the
fifth or sixth, century that the liturgica] influence belonged of which
I am secking the origin. Arles became at a fairly early date the focus
of ecclesiastical law in Gaul. I have shown (Fastes Episc„ vol. i. p. 141)
that almost all the Libri &monum in use in Merovingian Gaul were derived
from those of the Ohurch of Arles. In regard to the liturgy the matter
was different. Arles was not of sufficient importance at the time when the
Ohurches of Gaul ,felt the necessity of regulating the order of worship.
