256 CHRISTIAN wonsfflP: 1Ts omem AND EVOLUTION.

Preoamur ergo te, Domine, ut nos famulos tuos,1 omnem clerum et
devotissimum populum, quiete temporum concessa, in his Paschalibus

gaudiis conservare digneris.

These formularies were said, in Italy at least, from
separate rolls, which ,it was customary 1ο (16661616 66
sumptuously as possible. The text was ornamented here
and there with miniatures illustrative of various passages,
such as the angelie cheir, the earth illuminated with
celestial light, the church, the officiating deacon, bees,
616. The name of the sovereign at the end was sometimes
accompanied by his pertrait.2 In the ornamentation of
these rolls the figures were placed upside down, so that
the reader observed them turned in the opposite direction
from the text. This custom finds its explanation in the
fact that each roll, as it was read, was allowed to fall over
the side of the ambo, so that its end could be seized by
members of the congregation, and the miniatures contem-
plated while the deacon continued his chanting of the
remainder.

The Mozarabic Liturgy contains here, besides the
blessing of the new fire, which is not, perhaps, primitive in
this place, a twofold benediction‚ namely, that of 1116 lamp
and that of the candles. There were two officiating ministers
——deacons—who must either have composed the necessary
formularies themselves, or have known them by heart.

¹ The local community. We find here, 'm the copies, formularies in
which the pope, the bishop, and the sovereign, are named.

² This was the case in one of the Exultat-s preserved among the archives
of the Cathedral of Bari; we see depicted on it the portraits of two
emperors of the East, Basil II. and Constantine IX., then rulers of the
country. This roll furnishes a formulary which varies somewhat from
the usual text. Ι regret that Ι have been prevented from making a co
of it. The Benedictines of Monte Cassino have undertaken the publig
cation of the miniatures in some of these 16116, especially those of Gaeta
Fondi‚ Capua, and Mirabella (Le Miniature nei rotoli dell‘ Exultet, Monte,

CassinO, 1899). A more complete work 611 1116 same subject has just been
pubhshed by Mons. E. Bertaux, Πανί. dans Z’Italz'e me‘rz'dv'onale, Paris 1903
p. 213, 61 seq. For the text of the Exultet, 666 infra, p. 543. ' ⁹
