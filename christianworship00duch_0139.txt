CHAPTER V.

BOOKS OF THE LATIN RITE.

ANCIENT books of the Latin rite are much rarer than
we might be led to expect. It is useless to look for
anything of the kind in the Danubian provinces or in Latin
Illyricum, where the Churches of Dorostorum‚ Sardioa,
Salona, Sirmium, Siscia, and Savaria once flourished. A
wholesale destruction was effected in these countries by
the Germanic, SlaV, and Finnish barbarians‚ and though
no doubt, these countries have their liturgical history, it
begins very late, that is, in the ninth century, at the time
when the missionaries from Rome vied with those from
Constantinople in evangelising the conquering tribes which
thenceforward took up their abode in those regions Africa,
also, has nothing to offer us, unless it be the mention of a
Libellus sacramentoruml compiled in Mauritania, but now
hopelessly lost, and a few decisions, scattered among the
decrees of the councils. Ancient manuscripts of the Spanish
Liturgy are said still to exist, but up to the present time
nothing is forthcoming except the Mozarabic Missal, which
was recovered by the efforts of Cardinal Ximenes. With a

episcopus, scripsit adversus Ecclesiae inimicos, J udaeos et Arianos et alios

tho year 400, ecclesiastical legislation would lead us to suppose that the
bishops had, up to that time, considerable latitude in the redaction and use
of formularies. Councils of. Carthage of 397 (c. 23) and of 407 (cod. 103).
