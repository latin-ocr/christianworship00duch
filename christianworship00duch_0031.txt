The ecclesiastical local body was at first constituted and
organised on the model furnished by the Jewish communities‚
or at least under the influence of exigencies similar to those
by which the Jewish communities themselves had been
instituted and developed. Owing to the continuous advance
made in the propagation of the Gospel, there came a time when,
as a very early writer has remarked‚ “the children of the barren
woman surpassed in number those of the fruitful woman.'⁷ 1
The Christian population in each town rose from being an
insignificant minority to a respectable minority‚ became
afterwards the majority, and at length embraced the whole
population. It passed through these various phases in different
localities at widely different dates, Phrygia was almost
entirely Christian when Gaul possessed only a very small
number of organised Ohurches. The fourth century witnessed
the final stage of this change in nearly every region, at least
as far as the mass of the people in the towns were concerned.
This immense development modified but very slightly the
hierarchical organisation of the Churches. The number of
ordained ministers increased 3 some changes, some specialisa-
tion of power arose, but the government remained monarchical
throughout. It even tended to become more and more so,
The priests continued to be the counsellors‚ the substitutes‚
the assistants of the bishop3 the deacons and other lesser
ministers were still engaged in temporal duties, charitable
works‚ and the minor details of the service of God.

Roman municipal institutions‚ such as the curiae, the
duumviri, and the curatores, furnished no models for imitation
