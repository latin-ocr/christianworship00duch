368 GHRISTIAN woasfflr’: irs omem ΛΝΒ EVOLUTioN.

in altario poni quantum populo possit sufficere, ne aliquid putridum
in sacrario maneat. Pallae vero quae sunt in substraturio in alio vase

debent lavi, in alio corporales pallae. Ubi pallae corporales lavatae
fuerint, nullum linteamen ibidem aliud debet lavi3 ipsa aqua in baptisterio

debet vergi. Ideo te admoneo3 tu ita te exhibe ut Deo placere
possis.¹

Here came the traditio of the instruments, followed by
a call to prayer from the bishop—

Oremus Deum et Dominum nostrum, ut super servum suum Illam
quem ad subdiaconatus officium evocare dignatus est infundat bene-
dictionem et gratiam suam, ut in conspectu suo fideliter serviens destinata
sanctis praemia consequatur.

Then carne the blessing, as follows :—-

Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus, benedicere digneris
famulum tuum hunc Rlum, quem ad subdiaconatus officium eligere
dignatus es, uti eum sacrario tuo sancto strenuum sollicitumque caelesti
militiae instituas, et sanctis altaribus fideliter subministret. Requiescat
super eum Spiritus sapientiae et intellectus, Spiritus consilii et fortitudinis,
Spiritus scientiae et pietatis3 repleas eum Spiritu timoris tui ut eumin
ministerio divino confirmes, ut obediens atque dicto parens, tuam gratiam
consequatur.

Declamas—The formularies of the Missale Francorum
imply that the candidate, previously chosen by the bishop,
was presented to the people, who had to testify their
acceptance of him by an acclamation. At Rome, the silence
of the congregation was regarded as an expression of their
approbation of the choice made by the bishop. In the
Gallican ritual this approbation had to be openly expressed.
The Ember seasons‚ moreover, being unknown in countries
of the Gallican rite, the presentation to the people took

of the subdeacons. In the Gallican ritual, this choice, being effected in the
vesti-y, could be confided to subdeacons.

1 This address appears in the existing PontificaL but a number of
sentences have been added to it.
