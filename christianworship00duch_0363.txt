GEREMONIES 011 oHfflSTIAN INITIATION. 339

of that sect, and who then leaves it to enter the Catholic
Church, should be treated as a pagan, that is, as one not
initiated. He must be baptised, since the baptism he has
already received is not valid.

Tertullian's view was that of the African Ohurch, and
in particular that of the Metropolitan Church of Carthage.
The same practice was observed by the Ohurches of Syria
and of Asia Minor. This was not the case, however, at
Rome and Alexandria. In these two great Churches, and
in those following their direction, a distinction was made.
Baptism with water was admitted to be valid, whoever
had administered it and in whatever sect it had been con-
ferred, so long as the essential forms had been observed.
As to the remaining part of the inifflation, it was rejected,
and had therefore to be repeated in the case of the heretic
who demanded entrance into the Ohurch.

111 the year 256, the divergence between the African and
Roman practice was the cause of an animated discussion
between Pope Stephen and St. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage;
but the conflicting customs‚ notwithstanding, remained un-
modified. It was not until the Council of Arles, in 314,
that the Catholic 011111011 111 Africa gave up her ancient
practice.1 It was, nevertheless, obstinately persisted in by
the Donatists, who even applied it to the Catholic Church,
which was treated by them as a dissentient sect. The
vEastern Church also continued to regard the baptism of
heretics as invalid.2 Distinctions, however, soon came to
be introduced. We find the Council of Nicaea decreeing the
adoption of a different treatment towards the Novatians
and the partisans of Paul of Samosata.3 The seventh canon
