the Oriental Empire, and the obstacles he met with in 50
doing were one after another swept away.

The Church of Alexandria was the most energetic in
defending its privileges. The obstinacy of ancient Egypt,
its extreme centralisation concentrated in its patriarch, the
zeal and prestige of its monks, together with the traditional
and marked support given to it by the Roman Church‚
enabled the see of St. Mark to maintain its independence
for a long time. Men like Theophilus, Cyril, and the Dioscori
on more than one occasion made the bishops of the Imperial
city to feel their power. Heresy was the cause of their
ruin. The Roman Church on the one hand found itself at
length obliged to abandon the successors of Athanasius,
and the Council of Chalcedon on the other was the means
of humbling the pride of the ecclesiastical Pharaoh. Thence-
forward, split up into factions‚ exposed to internal quarrels
and secular troubles which alienated it from the Empire,
Christian Egypt fell an easy prey to Islam‚ and its separation

became an accomplished fact.
The remainder of the Eastern world was accustomed to

regard the capital as its centre. Antioch having lost this
position from the time of Theodosius, the entire East now
looked to Constantinople. The three northern dioceses,
originally cut off from the ancient capital, were soon seized
upon by the neW. The Bishops of Constantinople, upheld,
it must be admitted, by general opinion, soon began to
interfere in the ecclesiastical affairs of neighbouring (11000505.
Several instances of this interference, not without resist-
ance in some cases, had already occurred,1 when the Council
of Chalcedon gave the Bishop of Constantinople the right
of consecrating the provincial metropolitans of the three
dioceses, reserving only to the latter the ordination of their
suffragans. The same right of ordination was granted to
him in the case of the rulers of those national Churches
