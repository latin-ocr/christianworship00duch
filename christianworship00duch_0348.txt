Grod for those who are about to enter the consecrated
water-

Deus ad quem sitientes animae vivendi ¹ immortalitatis amore festinant,
da eis famulis tuis supplicantibus invenire munus quod cupiunt, adipisci
gratiam quod merentur3 ingrediantur fontem regenerationis auctorem, in
quo lethiferam illam primi parentis offensam, mutata in novum hominem

caducae carnis fragilitate, deponant.2

The blessing of the water doubtless took place before the
