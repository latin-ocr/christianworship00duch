metropolitan archives of Ravenna. The liturgical Bon, on
the back of which it was transcribed, must therefore have
the same provencmce. We have here, then, a collection of
prayers which had been in use 111 the Church of Ravenna.
One of them only, the twenty-seventh‚ is found in any
known document of the Roman Liturgy. It figures in one
of the Masses for Christmas Day1 in the Leonian Sacra-
mentary, and among a group of prayers for the same festival
in the Gregorian Sacramentary.2 The Ravenna prayers are
not arranged in the order observed in the Mass. There
is no attempt at any distribution of this kind, for they
are simply placed one after the other. They could have
served as well for the Office as for the Mass, and this
circumstance detracts considerably from the value of the
Ravenna Roll.

It is, moreover, difficult to assign a date to it. The
uncials are rather coarsely formed, and it may be attributed
with equal probability to the eighth or ninth as well as
to the sixth centuries.

Mons. Chatelain has published3 a series of prayers‚
which are in the script of the seventh or eighth century,
and accompanied by 6 certain number of Tironian 110166,ὗΙε
from a manuscript which came from Bobbio.4 They number
seventeen in all, and comprise the post communio prayer
and the Seoreta; they are Roman in type, and are found in
13116 Sacramentaries of that use, especially in the Leonian
