ORDINATION. 369

place only on the day of ordination itself. The following
is the address delivered by the bishop to the people in
presenting the candidate :—

Dilectissimi fratres, quamlibet possint ad ordinationem ecclesiastici
ministerii promovendam sibi ipsa sufficere privilegia sacerdotum, attamen
quia probabilior et nostra apud Dominum conversatio est et eorum
quorum honor augetur major est gratia si id quod arbitria nostra eligunt
etiam vestrae confirmet dilectionis adsensus, idcirco filium nostrum Illum
cupio ad officium diaconatus in consortium nostrum divinitatis auxilio
promovere3 an eum dignum hoc officio censeatis scire desider03 et
si vestra apud meam concordat electio, testimonium quod vultis vocibus
adprobate.

The congregation then exolaimed, Difflius est! 1 There-
upon the bishop calls upon the people to pray—

Commune votum communis prosequatur oratio, ut hic totius Eccle-
siae prece qui in diaconatus ministerio praeparatur leviticae bene-
dictionis² et spiritali conversatione praefulgens gratia sanctificationis
eluceat.

The bishop then pronounces3 the blessing, holding his
hand extended on the head of the candidate—-

Domine sancte, spei, fidei, gratiae et profectuum munerator, qui in
caelestibus et telrenis angelorum ministeriis ubique dispositis per

¹ This exclamation, as well as the address, to which it serves as a
response, was not in the books from which the existing Pontifical was
taken, but the beginning of the prayer which follows Commune votum,
implies that the announcement of the suffrages of the people had just
been made. These words have no longer a meaning in the present
arrangement of the ceremony.

2 Corrupt text. The Pontifical has: qui ad diaconatus ministerium
praeparatur, leviticae benedictionis ordine clarescat et spirituali, etc.

³ The existing Pontifical has here the Gallican invitatory Commune
votum, followed by a Roman invitatory, which is composed of two Roman
formularies of this nature, and ending with the Roman ccmsecratory canon,
Deus honorum dator (see above, p. 356).
