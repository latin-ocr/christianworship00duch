the ecclesiastical literature of the East. St. Isidore of
Pelusium 1 is already familiar with this sign of office
under its Greek name of omophorion; he attaches to it
also a symbolic significance, which leads us to think that
its introduction was not of recent date.

Ι should, therefore, be inclined to believe that its
origin must be sought rather in the fourth century than
in the century following.

In these early times, the pallium was the distinc-
tive mark of episcopal authority in full exercise. When
a Pope or patriarch was deposed, his pallium was taken
from him. When Pope Felix IV. desired to invest his
successor before his own death, he delivered up to him
his palliumss It would seem that in the East, and
also in countries following the Gallican use, the pallium
was worn indiscriminately by all bishops, and it is im-
possible to say whether or not they needed to be invested

with it by their metropolitans or patriarchs. The Roman γ

custom of reserving this mark of honour for certain bishops
only, and of sending it to them from Rome, appears to
be a modification of the primitive institution. Ι am rather
inclined to believe that it had some connection with the
change of ideas and of language which transformed an official
badge into a relic of the apostle Peter.

Although originally derived from the same source as
that of other bishops‚ the Pope's pallium acquired guadually
a different and more exalted significance. One circum-
stance which must have added considerably to its prestige‚
was the fact that, with the exceptions of those of Ostia and
Ravenna, the suffragan bishops of Rome had not the right
to wear it, either because the Pope, from the first, was
opposed to their receiving it, or else—which would be
