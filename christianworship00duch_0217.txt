Epistles. During Eastertide the Apocalypse and the Acts
of the Apostles were also read, and in Lent the “ Histories ''
of the Old Testament. On the festivals of the Saints their
biographies were included in the lections. This informa—
tion‚ which is furnished by St. Germain, is in full agree-
ment with the arrangement 111 1116 Luxeuil Lectionary,
with that in the present Mozarabic use,l and with the
distribution of lections in the Sacramentary of Bobbio.2
The use of Constantinople in the time of St. Chrysostom
made provision also for this threefold arrangement of
lections—the Prophetic, the Apostolic, and the Evangelical.3

After the reading of the two first lections‚ the Hymn
of the Three Ohssdren, according 10 St. Germain, was sung.
It was known also by the name of the Benediction (Bene-

it was customary 10 use it with the Gesta &aneatorum on the festivals of
saints. This is 1ο be inferi-ed from the letters of Paul (Bernried) and
Gebehard published by Mabillon (Mus. Ital.. vol¹ 1., part 2, p. 97): ‘⁶ Gestis
Sanctorum quae missarum celebrationibus apud vos interponi solent‚’' etc.
These letters were written about the year 1130.

served the Prophetic Lcction, which had fallen into disuse at Constantinople.

⁴ The Luxeuil Lectionary, however, prescribes for the Nativity‚ ‘⁶ Daniel
cum BenedictioneJ’ that is, the Hymn of the Three Children before the
Apostolical Lection. It is true that in the Mass of the Clarus-um Paschale it
places it after this lection.
