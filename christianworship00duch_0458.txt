432 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS omem AND EVOLUTION.

This ceremony 18 the principal religione rite. It 18
by the name of the velatio moptialis that the nuptial
benediction 18 known in the old Leonian Sacramentary3
at the end of the fourth century Pope Siricius1 speaks
of the velatio conjuyalis. St. Ambrose2 says also that
the marriage ought to be sanctified velamine sacerdotali
et benedictione. Not long since it was still the custom in
France to hold the veil (pallium, paleam, poele) extended
over the married pair during the blessing, but this
custom, not being mentioned in the Roman ritual, 18 fast
disappearing.3

The coronation of the newly wedded‚ which still
occupies such an important place in the Greek rite, has
6180 been given up in the West.

I have already stated that the old Merovingian books
do not contain the marriage rite. The Gallican use,
however, has, I believe, left a trace of it in the later
Μ188618, 111 13116 benediction which 18 pronounced over the
bride and bridegroom after the communion.4 Of the
three ancient Roman Sacramentaries, the Gelaeian‚ in
which we 80 often find Gallican prayers, 18 13116 only
one which contains a formulary of this nature. We
have seen, moreover, that benedictione at the time of
communion form an important feature in the Galh'can
liturgical system. The following 18 13116 formulary in the
Gelasian Sacramentary :—

¹ Decretal at Himera, 6. 4.

² Ep.. xix. 7.

³ yl‘hie 18 0116 of those ancient Roman rites which were better preserved
in France than in Italy, and which disappeared when the modern Roman
use was of late years adopted.

⁴ The formul-ary Deus Abraham . . . is now pronounced after the Ite
missa est, at the moment prescribed for the blessing of the people in the
Roman use. In the Gelaeian Sacramentary the benediction of the newly
married is placed immediately after the communion, before the prayer
post communionem.
