THE ROMAN “camme'' [enom THE MANUscRIPr or ΒΤ. AMAND.

ΤΗΕ manuscript) of the nini-,h cenbury (Parisinus 974), from which
I have taken bhese textas, cont-,ains bhe following breabises of
St. Augustine: De libero arbitrio et qratia Dei libri H. ; Altercatio
Feliciani arriani et beati Aaqastini, liber I. ,· De praedestinatione,
liber I. The provenanee of bhe manuscript] is St. Amand en
Puelle, as is shown by bhe following nobe, written ab bhe end :
Almae ecelesiae sancti Amandi in Pabula liber. Before and after
the text] of St. Augustine, a few blank sheebs remained‚ ancl
advantage was taken of these for transcribing ‘nhc Ordines.

These are drawn up in vulgar Latin (non yrammatico
sermone), which would, if the writer were a Frankish clerk‚ make
them of a datae anterior to 800 or thereabouts. If it were a
Roman clerk who transcribed them, then the datae might be
rather later. The manuscript is certainly nob an original. It is
a copy from an original which was full of abbreviabions, all of
which have nob been deciphered by the copyist with equal skill.
I reproduce ib as ita stands, with the exception of a few manifest
errors which were easily corrected3 in these cases fahe reading
of the manuscript is given ab the bottom of the page,
