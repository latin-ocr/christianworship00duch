76 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

Prayer of Oblation of Bishop Sarapion.

It is meet and right to praise, to hymn, to glorify Thee the
uncreated1 Father of the only-begotten Jesus Christ. We praise
Thee, O uncreated God, who art unsearehable, ineffable, incompre-
hensible by any created substance. We praise Thee who art known
of Thy Son, the only—begotten‚ who through Him art spoken of and
interpreted and made known to created nature. We praise Thee
who knowest the Son and revealest to the saints the glories that
are about Him: who art known of Thy begotten Word, and art
brought to the sight and interpreted to the understanding of the saints.
We praise Thee, O unseen Father, prcvider of immortality. Thou
art the Fount of life, the Fount of light, the Fount of all grace and
all truth, O lover of men, O lover of the poor, who reconcilest
Thyself to all, and drawest all to Thyself through the advent (ἐπιδημία)
of Thy beloved Son. We beseeeh Thee make us living men. Grive
us a Spirit of light, that “we may know Thee the True [God] and
Him whom Thou didst send, (even) Jesus Christ.⁷’ Give us Holy
spirit, that we may be able to tell forth and to enuntiate Thy unspeakable
mysteries. May the Lord J esus speak in us and Holy spirit, and hymn
Thee through uS.

*For Thou art “far above all rule and authority and power and
dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but
also in that which is to come.” Beside Thee stand thousand thousands
and myriad myriads of angeIS, archangels, thrones, dominions, princi·
pahties, powers (lit. rules, authorities): by Thee stand the two most
honourable six-winged seraphim, with two wings covering the face, and
with two the feet, and with two flying and crying holy (ἁγιάζοντα), with
whom receive also our cry of “ holy '’ (ἁγιασμόν) as we say: Holy, holy,
holy, Lord of Sabaoth, full is the heaven and the earth of Thy glory.

Full is the heaven, full also is the earth of Thy excellent glory.*
Lord of hosts (lit. powers), ffll also this sacrifice with Thy power and
Thy participation (μεταλήψεως); for to Thee have we offered this living2

¹ The word is ἀγένητον 111 the original. [Mgr. Duchesne rendered the
words ’γενητός and ἀγένητος by cre? and incre‘e‘ in the French—at the same
time regretting that that language did not permit of his using devenu and
indevenu (the latter does not exist) in an absolute sense—Ta]

‘⁶' [The Bishop of Salisbury compares this with the phrase of the Nestorian
Liturgy which speaks of the Body and Blood of Christ as being on the altar
before consecration (Brightman, p. 267).]

’¹‘ [The Bishop of Salisbury says there is much similarity in the passage
between these asterisks to the parallel passage in the Liturgy of st. Mark,
but the differences are also striking]
