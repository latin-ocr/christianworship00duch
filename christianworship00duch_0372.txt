were provided with clerics of that order. While the offices
of exorcist and lector are met with nearly everywhere,
that of the acolyte is lacking in some countries of the
extreme West.l After the foundation of the schola canto-
rum at Rome, the acolytes‚ being then the only minor order
engaged in active ministry‚ acquired a much greater impor-
tance than they had hitherto enjoyed. They are constantly
mentioned in the Ordines of the eighth and ninth 0601111166.
The cardinal priests had 00 011161 6661616016 10 111611 titular
Churches. In the pontifical ceremonies‚ all the inferior
offices, becoming increasingly complicated‚ were delegated to
them. During Lent, and at the solemnisation of baptism,
they fulfilled all the functions which hitherto had devolved

With regard to doorkeepers, lectors, and exorcists,
Pope Cornelius classes all three categories together, merely
giving us the total number. anh category contained
a less number than there were of the acolytes. Their
number would be in proportion to the various services
they had 10 render, and of these we have no precise
information.2

The doorkeepers are rarely mentioned in Roman docu-

mention is made of only one acolyte, viz. at Lyons, in 517 (Le Blant, 36).
The Statum prove that this order was known in the province of Arles.

² Figuring in the trial concerning the seizure of the Church of Cirta,
in 303, we find, besides the bishop‚ three priests, three (1660006, four sub-
deacons, and fossores in greater number, but of whom six only are named.
Besides these ecclesiastics, who were present at the seizure, there were seven
lectors. Neither acolytes‚ exorcists, nor doorkeepers are mentioned (Migne,
P. L.‚ vol. viii. p. 731). Notice the conformity in the number of priests and.
deacons with the prescriptions of the Egyptian Apostolic Constitutione
(Funk, Doctrina Apostolorum, pp. 62, 66; cf. Buzzetm Graique, vol. vii. p. 366).

the Liber Pontzficalis (vol. 1. p. 155) assigns as a companion in martyrdom
