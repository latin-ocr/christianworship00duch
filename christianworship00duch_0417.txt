shape, and to become even an accessory of ceremonia]
dress‚1 but not a distinguishing mark. Ι know of no
Roman representation of it before the twelfth century.
The priests and deacons whom we see in the mosaics
never exhibit this detail of costume.

Elsewhere it was not so. Towards the end of the
fourth century the Council of Laodicea in Phrygia forbade
the minor orders (subdeacons, lectors, etc.) to usurp the
orarium. St. Isidore of Pelusium2 regarded it as some-
thing analogous to the episcopal pallium, except that it
was of linen, whereas the pallium was of wool. The sermon
on the Prodigal Son, attributed to St. John Chrysostom‚
uses the same term ὀθόνη, and adds that this article of
dress was worn over the left shoulder‚ and that its fluttering
recalled that of angels' wingS.

The Greek deacons still wear the stole in this manner3

These distinctions are also found in Spain and Gaul.
The Oouncil of Eraga, in 561,3 decreed that deacons were not

which conferred upon it the nature of a relic. The oraria given to the
candidates for ordination on Ember Satur-days had been deposited during
the preceding night in the Confessio of st. Peter. It is curious that the
biographers of Popes Agatho and Stephen ΠΙ. use the word orarium to
designate the patriarchal or pontifical pallium (Lib. Pom„ vol. i. pp. 354, 472).
