THE DEDICATION OF CHURCHES. 417

1311010 can hardly be any doubt that it is a Gallican
ritual we have before us.l

A question still remains to be answered. What is
the origin of the ceremony of the alphabet2 It is un-
known in the East; and in the West‚ as we have seen,
it is not attested before the ninth century, even in the
Frankish Liturgy. From that date it is difficult to trace
it back to its true source, and to say whether it is
Roman or Gallican. sig. de Rossi² points out interesting
relations between this singular rite and certain Christian
monuments on which the alphabet appears to have a sym-
bolical signification. He has removed all doubt as to the
idea which suggested the ceremony. It corresponds with
the taking possession 01 land and the laying down its
boundaries. The 50113110, 01 St. Andrew's cross (crum decussata),
upon which the bishop traces the letters of the alphabet,

wished to measure. The letters written on this cross are
a reminiscence of the numerica] signs which were combined
with the transverse lines in order to determine the
perimeter. The 501105 formed by these letterS‚ moreover,

This profound symbolism, as well as the ancient custom
on which it is grafted, must go back to a time when
