the baptistery. 'He was immediately anointed,2 from head
to foot, with exorcised oil. In the case of the women, this
anointing was performed by deaconesses.

After this anointing‚ the neophyte entered the font,
which had been previously blessed by the bishop.3 He
once more confessed his faith, replying to the threefold
questioning of the officiating minister, and was then plunged
three times in the consecrated water.

Having quitted the font, the candidate4 was anointed

with perfumed unguents (μύρου, chrism). According 130
St. Cyril’s account, this was administered on the forehead,
ears, nose, and breast. He then turned to the east and
recited the Lord's Prayer.⁵ The ceremony ended with
the celebration of the Eucharist, in which the neophytes

infusion of chrism in the form of a cross,

⁴ It is here, according to Dionysius, that he resumes his garments.

⁶ This prayer is not mentioned either by Oyril or by Dionysius.

⁸ This custom which, even at Rome, fell into disuse at an early date
is still retained in the Coptic and Ethiopian communities.
