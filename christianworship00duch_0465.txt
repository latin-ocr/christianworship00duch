THE RECONOILIATION or PENITENTS. 439

at the beginning of the meeting, as coming forward at
the summons of the deacon‚ and as leaving the sacred
building after a special prayer, followed by the bishop's
blessing. This eustom was still observed at Rome in the
middle of the fifth century, as we have Sozomen’s ¹ express
authority for this.

The final ceremony——that of reconciliation———is found in
the Gelasian Sacramentary‚2 with very copious formularies.

By the help oi* this text we can imagine ourselves
at Rome on Maundy Thursday‚ the day specially set
apart in that city >for the reconciliation of penitents.3
Mass begins without any singing—that is to say, with-
out the chanting of the Introit 4——and without the Pope’s
salutation of the congregation by the Dominus vobiscum.
He recites an introductory prayer‚5 after which a deacon
brings before him the penitents‚6 who prostrate themselves
full length in the centre of 1116 611111611. Τ116 deacon then
addresses the Pope as follows :—

Adest, o venerabilis pontifex, tempus acceptum, dies propitiationis
divinae 61 salutis humanae, qua mors interitum 61 vita accepit aeterna
principium, quando in vinea Domini Sabaoth sic novorum plantatio

¹ Loc. cit. Of. supra, p. 171.
¹ Ι. 38; “ Orat. in quinta feria. Eodem die non psallitur, nec salutat,

id est non dicit Dominus vobiacum5 et reconciliatio paenitentis? Three
prayers follow, then: “Ordo eventibus publicam paenitentiam. Egreditur
paenitens de loco ubi paenitentiam gessit 61 111 gremio praesentatur ecclesie,
prostrato omni corpore in terra, et postulat in his verbis diaconus.’'

⁴ The Kyrie Eleison is no doubt suppressed because it 6011166 60 shortly
after; the same applies 10 the Gloria in excelsis. All these details, more
or 1666 definitely given, are contradicted by the Ordines of the ninth century,
which imply that the Mass began in the usual way. The latter contain,
moreover, no vestige of the reconciliation of penitents on Maundy Thursday.
It ie possible that this ceremony may have been abandoned in the course

of the eighth century.
⁸ The Gelasian Saoramentary gives three different forms of it, which

are evidently alternative&
⁶ The rubric and the formularies are always in the singular.
