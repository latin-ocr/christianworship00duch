Booizs or THE LATIN mm. 139

St. Gregory. It is true that the Sacramentary contains the
name of a St. Gregory in two places3 but even if there
be not a copyist's error between the two names Georyz'us
and Greyorz'us-an error of frequent occurrence in the manu-
scripts—it cannot, in any case, be St. Gregory the Pope, as
the saint in question is a martyr. Resides this, the Pope of
that name decreed that the prayer Hane iyitur oblationem,
in the Canon of the Mass, should from this time forward
conclude with the words, diesque nostros in tua pace disponas
atque ab aeterna damnatione nos eripi et in electorum tuorum
jubeas φερε numerari. It is true, indeed, that the Canon of
the Mass is missing in the Verona manuscript. It must have
been at the beginning, in the part now lost. The prayer
Home τρίταν, however, occurs a certain number of times in
the remainder of the text, yet never once with the Gregorian
ending. As we do not find elsewhere any other indication
of a date posterior to that of St. Gregory‚ we shall not be far
wrong in attributing the old Veronese Sacramentary to the
middle or end of the sixth century.

It must be a purely Roman book, not only because of
the absence of any traces of Gallie-an elements in it, or
because in the State prayers it always makes mention of
the Roman Empire with peculiar loyalty, but because it
exhibits on every page those topographical touches which
enable us to distinguish between a text drawn up for the
Church of Rome locally, and one which is merely in con-
formity with the Roman use. The rubrics which announce
the festivals of the saints often designate the place of the
station with marked topographical precision. Thus we have
