first Christians, at a time in which they were still almost
altogether congregated in the J ewish capital, took part in the
worship of the Temple, but without prejudice to their own
special meetings—those of the new synagogue which they
had established at the very beginning. Outside Jerusalem,

These meetings took place on Saturday. From a very
