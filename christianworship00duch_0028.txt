8 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

determining the organisation of ecclesiastical government,
and the form of public worship.

The Christian Churches appear before us in the earliest
documents as having over them a hierarchy of two or three
grades. The lowest grade is that of the ministers, or serving
brethren‚ to whom were entrusted temporal matters, and who
exercised the lower functions of divine worship. These were
the deacons. Above them were the “ elders,'' presbyteri, priests,
or the “inspectors,'' episcopi, bishops. It is clear that in
early times the use made of these terms was variable, as were
also the functions assigned to the persons they designated. At
any rate, it is certain that the priests or bishops who directed
a local community, recognised the apostles, of whatever
order, as possessed of superior authority, and as the founders
and spiritual masters not only of an isolated Christian body,
but either of all Christian bodies generally, or of those of
particular regions. As these great leaders gradually passed
away, a definitive hierarchy made its appearance. In each
town, all the Christians and all their directors, presbyteri,
episcopi, were ranged under a chief bishop, to whom this name
of bishop was shortly after exclusively applied. Around
him, and constituting with him a college, were his priest-
counsellors3 beneath them the deacons, who in their func-
tions, already become varied and numerous, were not long
after assisted by a whole staff of inferior ministers.

The question has been raised how far all this organisation
grew out of that of the Jewish communities. It appears to
me to have had its origin above all in the nature of things.
It is indeed difficult to imagine a community of the sort
that we are dealing with, without a council‚ a staff of working
functionaries, and a head able to act and direct.1 This was
the hierarchy bequeathed by the apostles, in the dawn of
