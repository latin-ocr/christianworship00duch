intact by the Creator of all things, through His well-beloved Son Jesus
Christ, by whom He has called us from darkness to light, from ignorance
to the knowledge of the glory of His Name . . . to hope in Thy ¹ Name,
from whom every creature proceeds, Thou 11051 opened the eyes of our
hearts that they may know Thee, Thou the sole Highest among the
highest, the Holy One who rests in the midst of the holy ones. Thou
who 01105051 1110 insolence of the proud, who scatterest the machinations
of the people, who exaltest the humble and puttest down the mighty3
Thou who givest siches and poverty, death and life, sole Benefactor of
spirits, God of all flesh, Thou whose regard penetrates the abyss, and
500115 the works of men3 Thou who art our help in danger, Thou who
savest 115 from despair, Creator and Overseer of all spirits3 Thou who
hast multiplied the nations upon earth, and chosen from among them
those who love Thee through J esus Christ, Thy well-beloved Servant, by
whom Thou hast instructed, sanctified, and honoured us. We beseech
Thee, O Master, be our help and succour. Be the Salvation of those
of us who are in tribulation3 take pity on the lowly‚ raise up them that
fall, reveal Thyself to those who are in need, 11001 the ungodly, and
restore those who have gone out of the way. Appease the hunger of
the needy‚ deliver those among us who suffer in prison, heal the sick,
comfort the faint hearted3 that all people may know that Thou art
the only God, that Jesus Christ is Thy Servant, and that we are Thy
people and the sheep of Thy pastui-e.

“Thou art He who by Thy operations hast manifested the ever-
lasting harmony of the world; Thou, Lord, hast created the earth, Thou
who remainest faithful throughout all generations, just in Thy judgments,
wonderful in Thy might and majesty, wise in creation and prudent in the
upholding of things created; Thou who showest Thy goodness in saving
us, Thy faithfulness to those trusting in Thee. O pitiful and merciful
God, forgive us our faults, our injustices, our shortcomings‚ our trans-
gressions; remember not the sins of Thy servants and Thy handmaids,
but cleanse us by Thy truth and direct our steps, that we may walk in
holiness of heart and do 11101 which is good and acceptable in Thine
eyes and in the eyes of our princes. Yea, Ov Lord, make Thy face to
shine upon 115, for our well-being and our peace, for our protection by
Thy strong hand and our deliverance from every sin by Thy mighty
arm, for our salvation from those who wrongfully hate us. Give peace
and concord to us and to all the dwellers upon earth, as Thou didst
give them to our forefathers when they called upon Thee with faith
and sincerity, in submissior] to the almighty power and supreme virtue

of Thy Name.
