42 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

323), Constantius (337-350), and Valens (364-378). When
Gratian associated Theodosius with him as emperor, he
entrusted him with the government of Eastern Illyricum,
which extended northwards as far as the Save, and west-
wards up to the Dalmatian mountains. Connected in this
manner with the Eastern Empire, these provinces could not
fail to be drawn within the ecclesiastical influence of
Constantinople. Greek was spoken throughout most of
them, and commercial intercourse and business of every
kind caused a much stronger drift in the direction of
Constantinople than in that of Rome or Milan. The Popes,
anxious not to lose the spiritual direction of so many
distinguished Ohurches, resolved‚ at an early date, to found
a vicariate at Thessalonica, of which that at Arles was
merely an imitation. More successfully managed than its
Gallican counterpart, it manifested a certain vitality, and
for nearly a century produced appreciable results. The
schism of long duration connected with Aeacius (484-519)
inflicted on it a fatal blow. Although we find as late as
the sixth and seventh centuries certain acts indicating
papal jurisdiction in these regions, they are either isolated
instances, or unconnected with the institution of the
vicariate. Of the latter nothing remained but the titles,
which the Bishops of Thessalonica and some others
delighted to parade at councils. In fact, if not in
theory, the provinces of Eastern Illyricum had passed
under the authority of the Patriarchs of Constan-

tinople.l

At the opposite extremity of the West, the Churches
of Britain, which had been destroyed by or had suffered
severely from, the Saxon invasion, had not long enjoyed,
if they had ever known, the metropolitan system.
