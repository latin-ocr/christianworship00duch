13. The Bobbz‘o Mis-sal}

One book remains to be described, which, like most of
the ancienb liturgical manuscripts, has received from its
original editor an incorrecta title. This is the Sacramen-
tarz'um Gallicanum of Mabillon. As the Missale Gothicum
and the Missale Gallicanum are thus designated, although
they are not Missals, but Saommentaries, so the Sacra-
memmium Gallicanum bears this name, albhough it is not
a Sacramentary, but a Missal. Mabillon found it ab Bobbio,
and published it in his Musaeum Italicum? The manu-
script, which was sent to St. Germain des Pres at the time
of publication, has remained at Paris ever since. 11) is now
in the Bibliotheque Nationale (No. 13, 246). Mons. Delisle
believes it] to be a work of the seventh century.

In spite of its great] antiquity‚ t-he Bobbio Missal is but
an indifferent source of information on the Gallican use. It
begins by a missa Romenszfs cottidiana, in which the Roman
and Gallican uses are combined in a peculiar fashion.
Up ‘co the meace, all the ribual is Gallicam from the
Preface onwards all is Roman. This is followed by the
Masses and ritual of the ecclesiastical year. The series
begins with three Masses in Adventum Domini, before
the Vigil of Christmas. The Saints' Days are few in
number. There is a Mass in honour of St. Sigismond
for those who are suffering from the quartan ague. In
each Mass we find, first] the text of the three Gallican
16611068, then the four prayers before the Preface, and
finally the lat‘cer under bhe rubrio Confestatio. N one of
bhe Masses goes beyond ‘ohe Sanctus, which implies that
they all terminated in the same way as the missa
Romanas cottidiana at the beginning of the Missal.
