16 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITs ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

close ties to Rome, from which, evidently, they had received
their first apostles and their organisation. Metropolis of all
Christendom, Rome was yet the centre of what might even
then be called a provincial government, or of an ecclesiastical
province.

Similar relations had been established, and for analogous
reasons, in other countries around certain large townS.
Carthage, for example, was always regarded as the centre
of African Christianity, both as regards evangelisation and
organisation. As early as the beginning of the third
century, its bishop had become a primate, or a patriarch.l
It was the same at Alexandria, and in a lesser degree at
Antioch, the oldest of the Christian communities in the
Greek world, and the centre of the earliest missions in
Northern Syria, Cyprus, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and
Persia. In Asia the missionary centres were more numerous,
and authority was more conflicting, owing to the presence
of so many celebrated cities, between whom a rivalry had
existed from fabulous times. Ephesus never enjoyed more
than a primacy of honour over Smyrna, Sardis, Pergamos,
and the other Churches of this region.

These relations between mother and daughter com-
munities may be taken into consideration in themselves,
without regard to the internal development of their
organisation. We have seen how, in the earliest Chris-
tian bodies, the single episcopate appears as the final
stage of an hierarchical evolution of varying duration.
Before this final stage had been reached, a body of
Christians might already have evangelised its immediate
and even remote neighbourhood, and formed colonies
which were bound to her as to their Mother Church.

ยน This local authority, however, was at that time less felt in Africa than
the higher authority of the Roman Church. This is particularly seen in
the writings of Tertullian.
