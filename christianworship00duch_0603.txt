PILGRIMAGE or ETHERIA (SILVIA). 577

above mentioned were consecrated, that should (also) be the day
when the Cross of the Lord was found, in order that the whole
celebration should be made together, with all rejoicing‚ on the
self-same day. Moreover, it appears from the Holy Scriptures
that this is also the day of Dedication‚ when holy Solomon,
having finished the House of God which he had built, stood
before the altar of God and prayed, as it is written in the books
of the Chronicles.

So when these days of Dedication are come, they are kept
for eight days. And people begin to assemble from all parts
many days before 3 not only Monks and Aputactici from various
provinces, from Mesopotamia and Syria, from Egypt and the
Thebaid (where there are very many Monks), and from every
different place and province—for there is none who does not
turn his steps to Jerusalem on that day for such rejoicing and
for such high days—but lay people too in like manner, both men
and women, with faithful minds, gather together in Jerusalem
from every province on those days, for the sake of the holy day.
And the Bishops‚ even when they have been few, are present to
the number of forty or fifty in Jerusalem on these dayS, and with
them come many of their Clergy. But why should I say more?
for he who on these days has not been present at so solemn a
feast thinks that he has committed a very great sin, unless some
necessity, which keeps a man back from carrying out a good resolu-
tion, has hindered him. Now on these days of the Dedication
the adornment of all the churches is the same as at Easter and
at Epiphany‚ also on each day the procession is made in the
several holy places, as at Easter and at Epiphany. For on the
first and second days it is in the greater chureh, which is called
the Martyrium. On the third day it is in Eleona, that is, the
church which is on that mount whence the Lord ascended into
heaven after His Passion‚ and in this church is the Cave wherein
the Lord used to teach His Apostles on Mount Olivet. But on

the fourth day . . .
