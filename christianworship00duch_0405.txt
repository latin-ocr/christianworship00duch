CHAPTER XI.

LITURGICAL VESTMENTS.

1. The Tunicle* and the Planeta.

IN the fifth century the outdoor costume worn at Rome by
official persons consisted essentially of two garments-an
under tunic, with or without sleeves‚ and a paenula, or
immense cloak‚ which was sleeveless and without any
opening in front. The head was passed through an aperture
made in the centre of the garment, and it was listed in
folds over the arms when the wearer required to make use
of his hands. We find this costume prescribed by a law
of 397,ι which forbids senators to appear at Rome wearing
the military chlamys, and permits only the use of the colo-
bium, a sleeveless tunic, together with the paenula. This is
the costume which we see portrayed in a painting of about
the fifth century, representing a Praefectus annonae with his
son.2 When, however, they were engaged in the exercise of
their fmrctions, the magistrates continued to wear the toga.
The officiales (apparitors‚ attendants), when in full dress,
also donned the paenula over the tunic; but in this case
the undergarment was confined at the waist by a girdle.

* [Ι have translated the word “tumque’' of the Frenoh original, by
“ tunic? when it denotes the classical garment, and “tunicle’' when the
liturgical vestment is in question. There is only one word for both in
