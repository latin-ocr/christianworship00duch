THE GHRISTIAN FESTIVALS. 273

to conjecture, where and how the two dates the 15th of

4. The Festival of the ist of January.

The festival of the Circumcision, as we understand it, is
not of Roman origin. There was, from the seventh century

the basilica of St. Mary ad Martyres, but the liturgical texts
prescribed for this day make no mention of the (311·0111110161011.2

been built in honore Alme Maria. It must not, however, be assumed from
this that the festivales the 1511101Ί August was then observed in Neustria. The
festival in the middle of August referred to in the inscription, and described
as being celebrated every year on the same day, was not that of the
Dormitio S. Mariae, but the dedication of the Church of Ham. This
dedication took place in 681 (Ball. des Antiquaires de France, 1886, p. 287).
