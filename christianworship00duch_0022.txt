⁴) CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

.-

the East were in need 01 011 increase 01 population to
ensure their prosperity. Since the time 01 1110 Exile the
Jews had greatly increased in numbers, and colonists could
readily be obtained from amongst them. Several dynasties 01
Αο10110 rulers—Assyrians, Babylonians, MedeS, and Persians
-had already had demonstration of the tractable nature 01
1110 Israelites, 01 their disinclination to play any part in
politics, and 01 their resigned and passive loyalty to their
conquerors. No sovereign could wish 10 have more faithful
subjecte provided he was 00101111 11101 their religious customs
should not be interfered with. This was 01 vital importance.
The Jews might be brought 10 live in 1110 midst 01 Greeks,
10 speak Greek, and even 10 forget Hebrew3 but 10 convert
them 10 polytheism was a thing not 10 be thought 01.
Α11110011110 Epiphanes, who attempted it, could 1101 congratu-
late himself on the success 01 1110 endeavour. On the other
hand, apart from the question 01 religious assimilation‚ it
was impossible 10 make a J ew 11110 0 11110 Greek, a citizen
01 011 Ηο1101110 town. This constituted an obstacle 10
00101110011011, but it was surmounted by arranging that
the Jewish colonists should 1101 be introduced among
the body 01 citizens, but assigned a privileged position
among those who were non-citizens. They possessed an
entirely separate administrative and ι111111010101001110011011,--
a privilege not shared, 101Ί instance, by the Syrians 01 Α11110011
or the Egyptians 01 Alexandria. Each Jewish community
rendered obedience to its own particular rulers, chosen from
among its members 3 it constituted a sort 01 subordinate
city, occupying an intermediate position between the Hellenic
city and the subject population. The religious scruples of
the Jews were, moreover‚ respected by law3 they could not
be compelled to break the Sabbath, as, for instance, by
appearing in a court 01 justice, and they were exempt from
certain burdens which were repugnant to them, such as

military service.
