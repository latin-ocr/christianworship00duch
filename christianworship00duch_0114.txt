94 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

many customs established which did not all seem to require
correction. It is supposed that, doctrine being safeguarded by
the very fact of his elevation to the see of Milan, Ambrose
thought it inopportune to introduce useless changes in the
domain of ritual. It is certain that many of the most
important Milanese peculiarities‚ from the point of view of
discipline and worship, go back to his episcopate, and, seeing
that these peculiarities have a distinctly Oriental character,
they could not have been introduced by him. It is more
natural to believe that they existed before him, and that
he had only sanctioned by his acceptance and practice
customs previously imported.l

Ι do not wish to be dogmatic on this point. Milan was
in easy communication with Constantinople and Asia Minor
through Aquileia and the Illyrian provinces, Auxentius
was not the only Greek who in the fourth century may
have exercised episcopal functione in a Latin country. His
action in the liturgical domain may have been but an
episode in a larger movement. Others might have acted
as he did in taking suggestions from the same models,
N evertheless‚ as far as Gaul and Spain are concerned‚ it
is very difficult to regard the development noted in these
countries as having proceeded from a Latin source further
removed than Μ11611.2

¹ To those who are sentimentally disinclined to accept a system which
would seem to ascribe an Arian origin to the Gallican Liturgy, I would.
say that Arianism has nothing to do with the question, which is concerned
solely with the Oriental form of the liturgy, a form of earlier date than
Arianism in the countries of its origin. I would add that, inasmuch as
forms of prayer were in the fourth century much varied and very easily
modified, it must be considered certain that St. Ambrose would have left
nothing in them which could possibly have fostered heresy. The liturgy
of the Apostolic Constitutione is of the same date and provenance. It
presente evident traces of theological speculations, which were current
in the region from which Arianism recruited its chief defendere.

² This does not exclude the direct importations of certain Byzantine‚
and especially Palestinian, usages. I shall have to point out several
instances of this kind.
