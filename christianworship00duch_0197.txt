THE ROMAN MAss. 175

the end of the apse. The offertory prayers now in use are
not indicated in the ancient books. They are, however,
complete counterparts, as far as the meaning is concerned,
of those employed by the Greek priests, and, doubtless, also
by the Gallican priests, before the beginning of the Mass at
the table of Prothesis.1

7. The consecratam Prayers.

As the preparation of the oblation takes place, according
to the Roman custom, at the altar itself, and during the
time of Mass, there is no room in it for the solemn entry
with the oblation previously prepared, of the Oriental and
Gallican ritual. The kiss of peace and the reading of the
diptychs are relegated to a later place. As soon as the
archdeacon has finished placing on the altar the loaves and
chalices to be consecrated, the Pope, after washing his hands,

proceeds to the altar and begins the consecration prayers.2
He calls the faithful, in the first place, to join in a prayer,

which is the second of the two collective prayers of the
Roman Mass, and is known by the appellation super oblata, or
Secreta. It is preceded by an invitatory of a special form:

see the following chapter.

² From several texts of the Liber Pontzflcalis (especially vol. i. p. 139,
note 33 and p. 246, note 9), compared with a passage in the Ordo Ι. of
Mabillon (c. 48), it would seem that the titular priests made use here
of a special rite at the outset. Some of the oblatae were held before them
on patens. They said the Canon at the same time as the Pope, and thus
celebrated the Eucharistic Liturgy with him. If I have rightly interpreted
the passages in question, this custom must have existed at the beginning
of the sixth century, as far as the stational Masses are concerned. In
the eighth century this custom was observed only on the feasts of
the Nativity, Easter, Pentecost, and of St. Peter. On other days the
co-operation of the priests was limited to the offerfflg, the fraction, and

the communion.
