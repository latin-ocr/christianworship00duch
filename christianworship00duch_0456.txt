430 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

All these rites are still found in modern uses. The
nuptial ceremony at the present time comprises the cere-
monies of the 10611011161, 65 well as those of marriage properly
so called. It begins by the declaration of consent, which,
as the marriage follows immediately after, has here the
character of an engagement de praesenti. The contracting
parties, interrogated by the priest‚ publicly express their
intention of being united in marriage.l Then follows the
subarrhatio, performed by the bridegroom, with a ring
previously blessed‚ followed, in many places, by the con-
veyance of the dowry‚ represented by a medal or piece
of money.

The whole of this constitutes the ancient ritual of
the betrothal‚ which formerly took place in the family
circle, and without the intervention of the priest. As
to the ritual of the marriage itself, the present use
and that of the ninth century both agree with that
implied in 1116 111051 ancient liturgical books. The nuptial
Mass is 11161 with in all the Roman Sacramentaries.2

Sacramentary 3 :—

¹ At this point, in the Middle Ages, occurred the formulary qu con-
jungo vos in mato-monium, 610, which 15, 65 may be seen, a sort of
interpolation in the primitive ceremony. This formulary, of which the
literal sense goes beyond the fact, has considerably contributed to a false
idea of the nature of the religious marriage, and has given rise to the belief
that the matrimonial tie depende on the authority of the priest. The
Council of Trent (Sess. xxiv.⁷ De ref. mar„ c. 1) mentions it without
enforcing its use.

²² The Gallican books give no Mass. Ι find in them merely a benedictio
thalami saper nubentes, comprising an invitatory and a prayer, in the Bobbio
Sacramentary (Murat.‚ ii. p. 956).
