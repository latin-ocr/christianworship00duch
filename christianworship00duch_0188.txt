the Mass, whereas from the Litany‚ a more ancient service,
it has been almost eliminated.

The Gloria in excelsis—This hymn, like the Kyme,
is of Greek origin. We find it, in a slightly different
form, however, in the Apostolic Constitutions1 (vii. 47),
and in the appendices to the Bible at the end of the Codex
Alexandrinus, which belongs to the fifth century. It was
a morning hymn, and formed partos the office for Matius,
and did not belong to the Liturgy properly so called. It
was originally introduced at Rome into the first Mass of
the Nativity, which was celebrated before daybreak. Pope
Symmachus extended its use to Sundays and the feasts
of martyrs‚2 but only in the case of episcopal Masses.
Priests were allowed to say it only on Easter Day, when
they were regarded as taking the place of the absent Pope,
or on the day of their first performance of sacerdotal
functions.3

3. The First Prayer.

After the salutation of the congregation, the celebrant
calls upon them to pray with him in the introductory

¹ The following is'the text in the constitutions .- “ Δόξα ἐν ὑψίστοις Θεῷ
καὶ ἐπὶ ’γῆς εἲρήνη, ἐν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκία.

σε διὰ τοῦ μεγάλου ἀρχιερέως, σὲ, τὸν ὄντα Θεὸν, ἀγέννητον ἕνα, ἀπρόσιτον
μόνον, διὰ τὴν μεγάλην σου δόξαν,

“ Κύριε, βασιλεῦ ἐπουράνιε, Θεὲ Πάτερ παντοκράτορ,

“ Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς, ὁ πατὴρ τοῦ Χριστοῦ, τοῦ ἀμώμου ἀμνοῦ, ὃς αἴρει τὴν
ἁμαρτίαν τοῦ κόσμου, πρόσδεξαι τὴν δέησιν ἡμῶν, ὁ καθήμενος ἐπὶ τῶν Χερουβὶμ,
ὅτι σὺ μόνος ἅγιος, σὺ μόνος κύριος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, τοῦ Θεοῧ πασῆς ’γενητῆς
φύσεως, τοῦ βασιλέως ἡμῶν, δι’ οὗ σοι δόξα, τιμὴ καὶ σέβας.”

The printed editions give at the end Ἰησοῦς Χριστός; which is evidently
an error, and must be corrected as I have done. This text breathes the
spirit of “ subordinationism.'' It has been carefully revised before inser-
tion in the Roman Liturgy.

(printed in the appendix of the present work) the chapter dealing with the
ordination of priests.
