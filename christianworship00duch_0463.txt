THE REOONGILIATION OF PENITENTS. 437

was ended, they were solemnly readmitted into the body
of the faithful, just as they had been solemnly introduced
into it at the time of their baptisma] initiation. There was
even a coincidence of time in the two ceremonies, for both
took place immediately before the Easter festival.

But few traces have come down to us from these early
times of the ritual in use for the admission to the number
of the penitents. It was necessary first to have acknowledged
the faults for which the penance was sought. We gather
from the life of St. Hilary of Arles1 († 447) that the
bishop gave an address, laid his hands on the penitents‚
and recited a prayer. The Council of Agde (506) also
mentions the imposition of 111111ᾶ5,2 to which was added
the giving of the hair-shirt. After this ceremony, the
penitents were obliged to wear mourning, the form of
which differed according to the customs of the country in
which they lived.3

At Rome, the purely unmixed liturgica] books, that is,
the Leonian Sacramentary and that of Adrian, are absolutely
silent with regard to the penitential rites.4 The Gelasian
Sacramentary takes for granted that, at the beginning of
Lent‚ the penitents entered a monastery, which they did
not quit till Maundy Thursday.⁵

³ “ Paeniteffles, temporo quo paenitentiam petunt, impositionem manuum
et cilicium super caput a sacerdote, sicut ubique constitutum est, conse-
quantur'' (can. 15).

² In Gaul, by shaving the head (Council of Agde, loc. ait.); in Spain
both hair and heard were allowed to grow (Isidore, De Eccl. Off> ii. 17).

⁴ In the Leonian Sacramentary, this may be owing to the mutilation of
tho manuscript.

⁵ It may well be asked, seeing the silence of the two other Sacra-
mentaries on the subject, if we are not here confronted with a ritual
which is Gallican rather than Roman. But this hypothesis is set aside
by the diction of the prayers, and by the mention of the Wednesday in
eapite jejunii, which, at the time of the transcription of the Gelaslan
Sacramentary, was still characteristic of Roman usage.
