THE GALLIOAN MAss. 225

short chant was sung, Which St. Germain calls the Tre-
oanam, and Which seemed to him to be an expression of
the doctrine of the Trinity. The following is the chant,
according to the Mozarabic formulary :——-

Gustate et'svidete quam suavis est Dominus. Alleluia! Alleluia!

Alleluia!
Benedioam Dominum in omni tempore, semper laus ejus in ore meo.

Alleluia! Alleluia ! Alleluia!

Redimet Dominus animas servorum suorum, et non derelinquet omnes
qui sperant in eum. Alleluia ! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Grloi ia et honor Patri et Filio et Spiritui sancto in saecula saeculorum.
Amen. Alleluia ! Alleluia! Alleluia 1

The two first verses are found in the chants for the
Gommunio in the Stowe Missal and 111 the Bangor Anti-
phonary. The latter are much longer than that just
given, but, like it, they are broken up by repeated
alleluias.l It is remarkable that the three verses of the
Mozarabic Traianum should be singled out from that
psalm (33) which in St. Cyril of Jerusalem, and in the
liturgies of the Apostolic Constitutions and of St. James,
is prescribed as the chant for the Communio.2

Ι think it worth while to give here, as a specimen of
Gallican liturgica] poetry‚ a hymn provided as a substitute
for the psalm at the Oommunio,

quando communicat dominicalem suum habeat3 quod si qua non habuerit,
usque in alium diem dominicum non communicet.''

¹ A chant with alleluia inserted at intel-vals, like this, is also met with
in the Armenian, the Syriae, and St. James's liturgies. The Ambrosian
Liturgy has here a chant called Transitorium.

² The verse prescribed in the Mozarabic Missal before the Post Communio
must have originally been attached to the Gustata. It runs as follows:
Refecti Christi corpore et sanquine te laudamw, Domine. Alleluia! Alleluia!

Alleluia Ι
