THE ROMAN MAss. 187

archdeacon, following the Pope‚ and the other deacons
following the bishops and priests, administer the chalice,
As the Pope's chalice is used only for communicating the
higher clergy, the archdeacon takes care to pour, beforehand,
into the vessels containing the consecrated wine for the
communion of the people, some drops from that used by
the Pope, and, afterwards, what remains in it after the
communion of the bishops, priests, and deacons. By this it
is intended to show, that, although all do not touch with
their lips the same vessel, yet they all drink the same
spiritual drink. The rite of the Oommixtw, having been
performed by the Pope in the principal chalice, is repeated

by the bishops and priests in all the other chalices, from
which the faithful are communicated under the species

of wine.

Before the communion of the people, the archdeacon
announces the day and place of the next Station. There
was an object in choosing this moment for the announcement.
Those who did not communicate were, doubtless, accustomed
to go out before the communion began. While the faithful
were communicating, the choir chanted the antiphon ad
communionem. At present it is chanted after communion,
and is restricted to the anthem [antz'enna see p. 115]‚ which
is sung only 01106. But the liturgical books of the ninth
century still presuppose here a real antiphon, the psalm
being chanted either in its entirety, or in part, according as
the time occupied in the communion is long or short. It
was terminated by the doxology Gloria Pac-rt, etc«, and the
antiphon [anticam] was repeated. This ebant, like that of
the offertory‚ must go back to somewhere about the end of
the fourth century.l

The communion having ended, the pope returns to the
altar, and salutes the congregation, inviting them to join
