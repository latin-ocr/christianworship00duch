archdeacon was contrary to that furnished by the Ordo,
and poor Amalarius was obliged to acknowledge that his
document was not without its shortcomings.1

It does not, moreover, require a lengthy examination
to see that the paschal Ordo does not possess the Roman
characteristics of the Ordo of the Mass. In taking up the
latter, we feel ourselves transported to Rome, into the midst
of the Roman clergy, to the city with its seven regions,
and its special days of service for each region. The
officiating minister is the Pope himself, domnas apostolicus,
who appears surrounded by the great dignitaries of his
court—the primiciarius, the secondieerius, the sacellarius,
the nomenclator, and others. He starts from his Palace of
the Lateran and proceeds on horseback in procession to one
or other of the Roman basilicas. It is clearly impossible
to refer these details to any other locality. In the paschal
Ordo, on the contrary, there are no indications of any
particular town, while it is an ordinary dignitary—a bishop
—who officiates‚ and sometimes even merely an inferior
ecclesiastic. The use is indeed Roman, but Roman as
observed elsewhere than in Rome, and combining with
it customs unknown to the papal court.

It is therefore impossible to attach the same weight to
the paschal Ordo as to the rest. It contains, doubtless,
many Roman details, but details which in every case
require to be confirmed by more trustworthy documents.

Among such documents is a fragment of a paschal Ordo
found by Signor de Rossi in the celebrated epigraphical
and topographical manuscript of Einsiedeln, and published
by him in vol. ii. of his Inscripi‘iones Christianae, p. 34.

Florus, Adv. Amalarium, i. 7 : “Libellum Romani ordinis tantae auctori-
tatis habet ut eum pene ad verbum nitatur exponere; et tamen statim
sibi ipse contrarius asserit hunc Romano archidiacono cuius traditionibus
gloriatur ignotum.'’
