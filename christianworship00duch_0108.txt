88 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

the use which is conventionally called the Gallican. The
latter was, therefore, already in existence at the beginning
of the fifth century; it had even sufficient vigour to enter
into competition with the Roman Liturgy, and that, t00‚
up to the surburbicarian diocese itself. This use, as is
evident from very numerous documents, was followed by the
Churches of Northern Italy (metropolitan diocese of Milan) 1
and by those in Gaul, Spain, Britain, and Ireland. From
what we can learn, however, from allusions by the Christian
orators and synodical decrees of Africa, the use there seems
to have been in absolute conformity with the use of Rome
and of Southern Italy. We thus find Rome and Carthage
on one side, and on the other Milan and the countries
beyond the Alps.

In grouping the transalpine countries with Milan, Ι
imply that the Ambrosian Liturgy is identical with the
Gallican. This is a view which is not generally accepted.
There is no difficulty, on the other hand, in the identification
of the liturgy of the Churches of Spain, or Mozarabic
Liturgy, up to the eleventh century, with that which was
followed by the Churches of Gaul before Charlemagne, and
with that which obtained in the British Isles before the
Roman missions of the seventh century. With regard to
the Ambrosian Liturgy it 13, in its present state, very
different from other types of the Gallican Liturgy, but we

¹ We have no documentary evidence for the uses followed in Aquileia,
in the Danubian provinces, and in Dalmatia. It is probable that the use
observed in Aquileia and the Danubian provinces resembled rather the
Milan than the Roman Liturgy. Dom. Gr. Morin has published lately
(Revue Be‘necl„ 1902, p. l) a Lectionary of the Gospels, which probably
belonged to Aquileia, and it contains nothing opposed to this view. The
