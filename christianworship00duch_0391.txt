ORDINATmN. . 365

officium tuum ut impleas illud: potens est enim Deus ut augeat tibi
gratiam.

These words imply ¹ that there had previously been
an election. The election having been annea-need, the
pontiff delivers an address to the congregation? in which
he dweUs upon the saith and ability of the candidate,
and then, in sight of all the people, puts into his hand
the book from which he was to read, saying-

Accipe, et esto verbi Dei relator, habiturus, si fideliter et utiliter
impleveris officium, partem cum his qui verbum Dei ministraverunt.

Then follows the prayer—-

Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus, benedicere digneris
famulum tuum nomine Illum in officio lectoris, ut assiduitate lectionum
distinctus atque ornatus curis modulis spiritali devotione resonet

eeclesiae.3

¹ They appear in the two Sacramentaries under the title Praefatio
hectoris, thus forming a counterpart to the invitatories employed for the
other orders3 but their form is widely different. I have been inclined to
place them at the beginning of the ceremony, that is, at the moment
indicated by the sense of the formulary. The blessing would thus
appear without an invitatory. Perhaps the address of the bishop took
its place; but this is not very probable. The Pontifical now in use has
a special invitatory.

2 Our manuscripts give us no formulary for this address. There is one
in the existing Pontifical‚ as well as for the three other minor orders, porter,
exorcist, and acolyte. I am not certain as to the exact date of their origin;
but it must be very early.

³ This text, which is that of the Gelasian Sacramentary, is corrupt and
unintelligible at the end. That of the Missale Francorum is not in a
better state: Ut assiduitate electionum distinctus atque ordinatus curis
modolis spiritali devotione linqua resonet Ecclesiae. In the existing Pontifica]
a lucid text is found here, derived from the foregoing; but it clearly betrays
the fact os having been touched up.
