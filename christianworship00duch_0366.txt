eentury, divides the heretieal seets into two categorias,
those whose baptism, but not confirmation, was accepted,
and those whose baptism and confirmation were both re-
jeeted.l The Monophysites, who separated from the Chureh
in the fifth and sixth eenturies‚ were treated m'th less
severity, and were admitted upon a mere profession of the

orthodox faith.2
The VVestern Chureh remained faithful to the old

Roman eustom‚ which was often enjoined by the Popes.
Couneils‚ aeeounts of conversions of hereties, and even
