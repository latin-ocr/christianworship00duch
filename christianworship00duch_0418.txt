be distinguishable from subdeacons, but above it, and over
the shoulder. The Council of Toledo, in 633, defined (c. 27>
the orarz'um as a distinguishing mark, common to the
three major orders, bishops, priests, and deacons. It specified
(0. 39) that the deacon should wear it over his 1011
shoulder, and that it should be white, without admixture

Eraga, held in 675, forbade priests (c. 3) to celebrate
Mass without having an orarium passed round the neck
and crossed on the breast, exaotly as the Latin priests
wear it at the present day. St. Germain of Paris speaks

the albe. This fashion 01 wearing the diaconal stole

itself the ancient custom seems to have been retained,
but with a compromise. When the (1100011οΙ stole was at
length adopted there, it was worn, indeed, across the left
shoulder, but always under the dalmatic or planeta.2

The presbyter's stole was also adopted, and in the
mosaics 01 Santa Maria in Trastevere (twelfth century)
we see 0 priest wearing that vestment. It is to be noted
that the four Popes who appear in the same mosaic are
wearing the pallium, but not the stole. The one seems to
exclude the other. In fact, the Ordines of the ninth
century, when describing the dress 01 1110 Pope, always
omit the stole. On those monuments, moreover, where both
