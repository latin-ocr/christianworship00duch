ORDINATION. 375

Leonian and Gregorian Sacramentaries.1 It implies‚ like
the remainder of the formulary, that several bishops are
consecrated at the same time, whilst the two addresses
quoted above are always in the singular number.2 Else—
where than in Rome the simultaneous consecration of
several bishops must have been a rare occurrence. Ι am
therefore inclined to believe that the formulary is thoroughly
Roman, and that no Gallican form for this part of the

ceremony has been preserved.

While the presiding bishop-—that is, the metropolitan—-
is saying the consecrating prayer, two bishops hold over
the head of the candidate the open book of the Grospels
and each of the bishops present places his hand upon

him.
After 1116 consecrating prayer came 1116 anointing of

the hands,3 which ceremony was accompanied by the
following prayer 4 :-—-

Unguantur manus istae de oleo sanctificato et chrismate sanctifica-
tionis, sicut unxit Samuel David in regem et prophetam; ita unguantur
61 consummentur in nomine Dei Patris et Filii et Spiritus sancti, facientes
imaginem sanctae crucis Salvatoris domini nostri Jesu Christi qui nos
a morte redemit et ad regna caelorum perducit. Exaudi nos, pie Pater,
omnipotens aeterne Deus, et praesta quod te rogamus et oramus.

¹ See above, p. 361.
² The same must be said of the Roman introductory prayers which the

Missale Francorum places before the address. The formularies after the
consecrating canon in the ordination Mass are, on the contrary, all in
the singular number.

³ The anointing of the hands is the only method of unction mentioned
in the ancient Merovingian books. That of the head is not found there:
but in the time of Louis the Pious it was the customary usage in France
(Amalarius‚ De Eccl. Officiis, ii. 14).

4 It is found only in the Missale Francorum following that of the priests
(see above, p. 372), under the rubrio item alia. Ι think that this is not a simple
variant, but a special formulary for bishops. This distinction is conform-
able with present usage, according to which the formulary Consano-entur is
used for priests, and that of Unqusmtur for bishops.
