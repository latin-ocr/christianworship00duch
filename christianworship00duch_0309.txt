days. It was for this reason, as we have seen,l that the
Council of Elvira restricted the custom of weekly super-
positions to once a month. At Rome, from the time of
St. Leo, no more than four were provided in each year,
but fifty years previously they appear to have been more

the paschal solemnities were observed as fasts everywhere.
At Milan, in the fourth century, the ten days between

until after Pentecost. This was the custom in the East, in
