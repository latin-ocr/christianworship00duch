CEREMONIES OF CHRISTIAN INITIATION. 299

sequente illa feria, circa horam diei sextam convenire dignemini, ut
caeleste mysterium quo diabolus cum sua pompa destruitur et janua
regni caelestis aperitur, inculpabili, Deo juvante, ministerio peragere
valeamus.

At the first scrutiny the elect gave in their names,
Which vvere inscribed in a register. Thcn the sexes were
separated, the men being placed on the right, and the
women on the left.

The Mass then began. After the collect and before
the lections‚ a deacon called upon the catechumene to
prostrate themselves in prayer. The prayer was con-
cluded by all of them saying in a lond voice, Amen.
Always at a signal from the deacon they signed themselves
with the sign of the cross, saying, In nomine Patris, etc.
The exorcisms took place at this point in the service.
One of the clergy,1 whose duty it was, approached the
male candidates, and having made the sign of the cross on
the forehead of each, imposed his hands upon each and
pronounced the formulary of exorcism. He then proceeded
to the female candidates, and repeated the ceremony. A
second exorcist followed him, and then a third, performing
the same act. I give here one of the formularies used—

Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac, Deus Jacob, Deus qui Moysi famulo tuo
in monte Sinai apparuisti et filios 1srael de terra Aegypti eduxisti,
deputans eis angelum pietatis tuae qui custodiret eos die ac nocte3
te quaesumus, Domine, ut mittere digneris sanctum angelum tuum
ut similiter custodiat et hos famulos tuos et perducat eos ad gratiam
baptismi tui.

Erg0,2 maledicte diabole, recognosce sententiam tuam et da honorem
Deo vivo et vero, et da honorem Jesu Christo Filio ejus et Spiritui
sanct03 et recede ab his famulis Dei, quia istos sibi Deus et dominus

¹ The Ordo and the Saorccmentary mention acolytes in this place,
but it is certain that as long as there were exorcists in office, this was

not the duty of acolytes.
² This portion of the formulary is invariable, It is repeated at each

of the six exorcisms.
