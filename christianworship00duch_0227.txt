THE GALLIGAN MAss. 205

The bread is brought in a vessel having the form of a
tower,1 and the wine, mixed with water, in a chalice. Resides
these two eucharistic vessels, the paten also was employed,
in which the consecrated bread was placed, either at the
time of the preparation, or at the altar during the con-
secration. There were also, as it appears, three veils, one
of which, the corporalis palla, was of linen, without any
admixture (pura linea). This was the cloth for the altar.
The other was of silk, and was ornamented with gold,
and even with genis. It was used to cover the oblation
after it had been placed upon the corporal. I am at a
loss to know the purpose served by the palla linostima,
of which Germain speaks first of all. In the Byzantine
rite there was one veil to cover the paten and the bread‚
and another to cover the chalice, and a third to cover both
together.

During the procession a chant, similar to the Byzantine
Cheroubim& was sung by the choir, and ended, like it,
with the Alleluia. This is what St. Germain calls the
Sonus. In the Mozarabic Liturgy it bore the name of
Laudes, a word already met with 111 the seventh century.2
At Milan it was called the Antiphona 290325 Emmqehum.
When the sacred elements were placed upon the altar,
they were covered by the precious veil.3 The choir then

and on the day of St. Polycarp. “Lecta igitur passione (S. Polycarpi)
oum reliquis lectionibus quas canon sacerdotalis invexit, tempus ad saeri-
fieium offerendum advenit. Accepta quoque turre diaconus, in qua
mysterium Dominici corporis habebatur, ferre oepit ad ostium; ingres-
susque templum ut eam altari superponeret, elapsa de manu ejus ferebatur
in aera, et sic ad ipsam aram accedens, nunquam eam manus diaconi potuit
adsequi; quod non alia credimus actum de causa, nisi quia pollutus erat
in conscientia.'' Krush, in dealing with this passage, is wrong in eon-
founding the use of this tower with that of the Capsa, in which tho
Eucharist was carried in the Roman Mass.
