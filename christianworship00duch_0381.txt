ORDINATION. 355

It was on a Saturday evening, at- the Mass of the
Vigil, that ordinations took place. The eighth-century
texts imply that this Mass had already been transferred to

or the priesthood. This Ordo, like the two others of a
similar character, implies that deacons and priests were
ordained at the same time, the subdeacons intended for

for the diaconate‚ and then immediately afterwards that
for the priesthood.2

intended to take orders. It was owing to this that digamists were
excluded, without a discussion of the question whether the first marriage

insists strongly on this point.
