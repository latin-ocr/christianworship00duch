It contains merely the three last days of Holy Week, but
it is absolutely Roman in character.

Mabillon's Ordo VII„ relating to the ceremonies of
Christian initiation-—the catechumenate, baptism, and 6011-
firmation—is as well attested by documentary evidence as

5th, the dedication of churches3 oth, the procession at
Candlemas. In all these ceremonies the ritual is strictly
