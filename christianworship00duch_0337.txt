font. The archdeacon presented them, one by one, to the
Pope, who put to them the three questions, which epitomised
the whole Oreed—

Credis in Deum Patrem omnipotentem?

Credis et in J esum Christum, Filium ejus unicum, dominum nostrum,
natum et passum?

Credis et in Spiritum sanctum, sanctam Ecclesiam, remissionem
peccatorum, carnis resurrectionem?

After his threefold reply in the affirmative, the can-
didate was thrice immersed, while the Pope pronounced
the formula, Baptizo te in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus
sanati.

Baptismal immersion did not imply that the person
baptised was entirely plunged in the water. He entered
the font, in which the water would not reach beyond
the middle of an adult, and was placed under one of
the openings from which a stream issued, or else the
water was taken from the font itself and poured over
his head. It is thus that baptism is represented on the
ancient monuments

The actual ceremony of baptism was not performed by
the Pope alone. Priests, deacons, and even clerics of
inferior order, entered the water, clothed in long linen
tunics, and administered the sacred washing to the crowd
of neophytes.

deaconesses had here an important part to play in connection with the
baptism of the women (const. Ap„ iii. 15, 16). It must not be thought,
however, that propriety in ancient times was as easily offended as it would
be now. The author of De siozqularitate clericorum (Cyprian, App„ p. 189,
Hartel) does not understand that in ipso baptismate cujusquam nuditas
erubescat, ubi Adae et Evae renovatur infantia, nec exponit scd potius accipit
tunicam. Cf. the curious story related by John Moschus in his Prat.
Spin, ch. 3.
