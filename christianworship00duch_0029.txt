EGCLESIASTIOAL AREAs. 9

Christianity, to the Ghurch of Jerusalem, the first in point of
time of all Christian Churches, and the most favourably
placed in those early days to serve as a model. From
this period the question under discussion loses much of its
interest. It is one, moreover‚ somewhat difficult to treat
with any degree of precision, owing to the paucity of the
information we possess with regard to the organisation of the
J ewish communities of the Dispersion. The condition of these
differed widely. In some instances‚ where the Jewish popu-
lation was considerable, several synagogues were to be found
in one and the same town, although the Hebrew community
as a whole was under a single ruler. This was the case at
Alexandria, where the Jews were under the direction of their
Echnarch. At Smyrna, an inscription ¹ mentions “the nation
of the Jews 3 ’² but it does not state whether there also they had
an ethnarch or some similar magistrate. If from the organi-
sation of communities regarded as national bodies we pass
to that of the synagogues, which in many cases must have
served both purposes, the information is still more uncertain.
The Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles frequently make
mention of the rulers of the synagogue3 but the information
is rarely definite enough to enable us to determine whether
each synagogue had one or several rulers. When they do
exceptionally give us the distinct information we require, it
is not of such a character as to enable us to infer the exist—
ence of a single and universally recognised type. In the
district of Galilee, where the raising of Jairus’s daughter took
place, there were several “rulers of the synagogue.’'2 In
the locality where the woman with the spirit of infirmity
was healed 3 there was only one. The same want of uniformity

burying-place, τῷ ἔθνει τῶν Ἰουδαίων. This inscription has been published
by M. Salomon Reinach in the Revue des Etudes Juives, 1883, p. 161.
