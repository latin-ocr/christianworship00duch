52 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

“It is Thou, Lord, who hast given to our princes,¹ to those who rule
over us upon earth, the power of royalty‚ by the excellent and unspeakable
virtue of Thy might, in order that, knowing the glory and honour which
Thou hast conferred upon them, we may submit ourselves to them,
and not put ourselves in opposition to Thy will. Grant them, Lord,
health, peace, concord, and stability‚ that they may exercise unhindered
the authority with which Thou hast entrusted them. For it is Thou,
O heavenly Lord, King of the ages, who givest to the sons of men
glory, honour, and power over earthly things. Direct their counsels,
O Lord, according to that which is good, according to that which is
acceptable in Thy eight, so that exercising peaceably and mercifully the
power which Thou hast given them, they may obtain Thy favour.
Thou aione hast the power to do this, and to confer upon us still greater
benefits. We confess Thee through the High Priest and Ruler of our
souls, Jesus Christ? through whom glory and majesty be to Thee nOW‚

and throughout au generations, for ever and ever. Amen.” ²

In addition to these documents drawn up at Rome, I will
further quote the formularies preserved to us in the Doctrina
of the Apostles, a very ancient writing‚ contemporary, at the
latest, with St. Justin, but of whose provehente& nothing is

definitely known.

“As to the Eucharist‚ we give thanks in this wise. First for the
chalice: We, thank thee, our Father, for the Holy Vine of David, Thy
servant? which Thou hast made known to us by Jesus Thy Servant}
Glory to Thee for evermero!

“For the breadz⁴ We thank Thee, our Father‚for the life and the
knowledqe which Thou hast made known to us by Jesu3‚ Thy Servant.
Glory to Thee for evermore! As tlze elementis of this brem, scattered οη
the τηοαηΐαίηε, were brouyht toqeffier into α sinyle whole, may Thy Ohurch
in like manner be yathered tcyether from the ends of the earth into Thy
kinydomg for Thiae is the ylory and the power, throuyh Jesus Christ,

for evermore.

¹ Note the spirit in which the Christiane at Rome prayed for the emperor

on the mori-ow os the fury of Domitian.
² 1 Clem. 59—61.
³ “ τοῦ παιδός σου,” in both cases, and further on.
4 ‘⁶ περὶ τοῦ 'cadeira-ros? This refers to the bread as already broken or

about to be so.
