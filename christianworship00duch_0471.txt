THE REGONCILIATION OF PENITENTS. 445

Bessween this picture and the rissual of the Mozarabic
Missa} there is the differenoe which in matters of this
nature separates the thjrd century from bhe sixth. But
'che ories of Indulyentz'a which on Good Friday once rang
through the Churches of the Visigo'ohio kingdom are direotly
deseended from the ories of pity which the persevering
faithful of old times raised, either spontaneously, 01· ab the
exhortations of the bishop‚ when a repentanb sinner came to
beg for readmission into the Christian assembly.
