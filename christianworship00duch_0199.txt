THE ROMAN ΜΑ55. 177

still further back, and show conclusively that the prayer
to which St. Leo added four words was already in being
in the time of Pope Damasus. The proof is to be found
in a criticism levelled at it by the author of the Quaestiones
Veteris et Novi Testamenti,l who was a contemporary of
Damasus. In the misleading theology of this writer, Mel-
chisedec is identified with the Holy Spirit, and, while he
is still recognised as the priest of God, Melchisedec’s priest-
hood is considered as inferior to that of Christ: Simi-
liter et Spiritus sanctus qnasi antistes sacerdos appellatas est
excelsi Dei, non suminus, sient nostri in oblatione praesumunt.
Quia quamvis unius substantiae Christus et Spiritus sanctas,
uniuscujusque tamen ordo observandus est. The words non
summus sient nostri in oblatione praesamant have evidently
in view the form of the Roman Epiclesis, summus sacerdos
tuns Melchisedech.

We find, furthermore, in a work not much later than
the time of Damasus—the De sacramentis of the pseudo-
Ambrose--large portions of the Roman Canon. Although
we cannot assign a precise date to this work, or give the
name of its author, it would seem, in my opinion, to have
been drawn up in some North Italian Ohurch, where the
Roman use was combined with that of Milan, probably at
Ravenna. As it assumes that the population of the towns
15 still made up of pagans and Christians, and as it is,
moreover, partly borrowed from a similar work of St.
Ambrose, we cannot go far wrong in fixing its date as
somewhere about 400. The portions of the Roman Canon
which appear in it run as follows 2 :—

of Bruges, in his work entitled Litaryica Latinorum (vol. i. p. 301), published
at Cologne, in 1571, introduces this fragment into the middle of the prayers of
the Ambrosian Mass, and from this fact it has been usually cited as the “Am-
brosian Canon.’' There never was, in fact, an Ambrosian Canon. Before the
