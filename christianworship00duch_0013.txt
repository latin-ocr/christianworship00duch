AUTHoa's PREFACE. ix

be added a chronological one. As I did not
intend to treat of anything posterior to the eighth
century, Irhave been obliged to omit certain cere-
monies, some of them even of an imposing character,
which were not introduced until a later date, or of
which the ritual has come down to us in a form too
far removed from its primitive condition. I allude
especially to the rites connected with the inaugura-
tion of sovereignsâ€š an act of great importance,
whether viewed from the political or the religious
standpoint. In France this ceremony is not older
than the accession of the Carlovingian kings, and if
we have reason to believe that it was practised some-
what earlier in the British Isles and in Spain, there
is no document extant which enables us to gather
the details of the ceremony at that remote date.

The various rituals sor the consecration of the
emperors in the basilica of St. Peter at Rome have

been recently classified, but none of them, in my
opinion, goes back even as far as the ninth century.
Such is the scope of the present volume. I have
thought it necessary to define it, in order that the
reader may not look for that which I was neither
capable nor desirous of including within its pages. It
merely remains for me to add that the work I set my-
self to accomplish was that of the historiali, or perhaps
even of the antiquary, and that I had not the least
desire to protest against the changes introduced into
liturgica] usages in the course of centuries or by the
decisions of competent authorities. It is possible to
take an interest in the history of the Merovingians
