450 CHRISTIAN woRSHIP: rrs omem ΛΝΒ EVOLUTION.

priests and as many deacons took their turn in reoiting the
prayers‚ for it was an understood thing that, in assemblies
of a certain importance, the general pmyers, litanies, and
other devotions‚ could be conducted only by the higher
clergy. Any other practice would have been considered
somewhat perilous‚ from the standpoint of ecclesiastical
unity. But this was not the only part taken by the
clergy in the office of the ascetics. When the psalms‚
interrupted by prayers, were drawing to a close, the bishop
and clergy entered the church. From this point onwards 13116
service became definitely ecclesiastical. Prayers were said,
first with the catechumens present, 1311611 with 13116 faithful
only, the catechumens being dismissed after a certain time, as
in the liturgical Synaxes. The congregation did 11013 break
up without receiving the bishop's messing, and 113 was even
customary that all should kiss his hand before leaving
the church.

On Sundays and festivals the ancient Synaxes were
again resumed. The private office followed, and took place,
if time permitted‚ in the interval between the Vigii and the
Mass. At cock-crow all the clergy, headed by the bishop‚
were present at the night office, which was attended by far
greater numbers than on week-days. At daybreak Mass was
said in the great basilica (Martyrium) close 130 13116 Holy
Sepulchre. The service was a very long one, so that there
was only time after it for the lucernarium, 60ωὲ and none
having to be omitted.

It is needless to say that regular attendance at such
frequent offices could not be expected of every one. St.
Chrysostom1 mentions some of the objections made on this
60016 by the laity of his time. “ Is it possible ’' (116 makes
his hearers say) “ that a man of the world, engaged in the
business of the tribunals, can be interrupted three times
