160 cHRIsTIAN wosssHIP: rrs omem AND Evomrion.

The Roman Canon is frankly adopted, more completely,
indeed, than in the Ambrosian rite, which has in this portion
01 the service retained a few peculiarities.

14. Ambrosiam Books.

We find a considerable number 01 liturgical manuscripts,
compiled for Churches using the Ambrosian rite, pre-
served in the collections of North Italy, particularly in the
Ambrosian collection at Milan, and in the treasury 01 1110
cathedra] 01 11101 town. The most ancient are of the tenth
century. The first of the series is the Sacramentary of
Biasoafl which is somewhat coarse in execution, as might
be expected, since it was a book for the use of a country
parish. In the Ambrosian books, the ecclesiastical year
begins 011 St. Martin's Day (November 11), and we find
the Ordinary of the Mass placed after Whit Week, in the
middle 01 1110 volume. Besides the Sacramentaries‚ there are
also a few Antiphonaries.2

¹ Ambros.‚ A 24 bis inf.; Delisle, No. 71. It is not within the scope
of this book 10 describe, even briefly, the manuscripts of the Ambrosian
Liturgy, and I have not studied them for a long enough period to be
competent to do so. I have learnt much in the short time which I have
been able to devote to them, owing to the fact that I had as my guide
the Abbe Ceri-ani, the most learned expert on the Milanese Liturgy. It
is to be hoped that 110 will one day publish the results of his long and
conscientious researches. Meanwhile the description of the most ancient
Ambrosian Sacramentaries will be found in the memoir of Mons. L. Delisle,
p. 198, et seq. See also article “Ambrosien⁷' (rit) in Dom Cabrol's Dict.

² The Benedictines of Solesmes have published (1896) in volume v. of

their Pale‘oqraphie Musicale, an Ambrosian Antiphonary 01 1110 twelfth
century. Dr. Magistretti edited in 1894 the Beroldus, a ceremonial repre-
senting the customs of the same period; he has, moreover, begun a collection
entitled, Monumenta veteris Μίαν-9100 Ambrosiamae, the first number 01 which
(1897) contains a Pontifical 01 1110 11111111 century. Attention may also be
drawn 10 1110 studies of Signor Mercati in No. 7 of the Studz' e Testi of the
Vatican Library. The Benedictines of Solesmes published in 1900 a
Sacramentary of Bergamo of the eleventh century, with three capitularies
of the Gospels. This edition constitutes the first number of their liturgica]

supplement to Migne's Patroloqia Lat.
