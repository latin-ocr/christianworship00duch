for the stational Mass. The difference in place depended
on the character of the congregation. At the Masses cele-

brated in chapels, cemeteries, presbyteral churches‚ and even
in the great basilicas, there were present, the stational days
excepted, only a private congregation, consisting of a family,
or a corpomtion, or the inhabitants of a quarter, or any kind
of association of the faithful, whether resident or pilgrims.
The Mass said on such occasions was a private Mass. The
public Mass, that is to say, the stational Mass, was that in
which the whole church was considered to take part.

This public Mass is that which agrees best with the
primitive type of the institution, and on that account its
study is the more important. As we find it described in
the Ordines of the eighth or ninth century, it implied a
ceremonial which corresponded more with the exigencies
of a later date than with those of primitive times. The
pontifical court, which had then reached a considerable
development, played in it an important part. The different
classes of the clergy, arranged according to their orders
and to their regions, the corporation of cantors, the crucifers
of the quaiter, the military and civil rulers, and, in fact,
everybody, had his part in these high ceremonials of wor-
ship. Ι will put on one side everything in the Ordo which
has to do with this high ceremonial, and will confine myself
to those rites which are essential, and which are common to
the Roman and other liturgies

1. The Entry of the Officiatz'nq Priest.

The congregation of the faithful having assembled, the
priests, accompanied by the bishops then in Rome, took
their places in the apse of the church which was reserved for
the superior clergy. The pontiff and his deacons set out
from the secretarium, or sacristy (which was situated close
to the entrance of the church), and proceeded to the altar.
