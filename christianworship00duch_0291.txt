THE cflfflsrrAN FESTIVALS. 267

It is manifest that these anniversary dates were fixed
arbitrarily‚ and that there was no historical support for
their adoption. St. J ames, son of Zebedee, is the only
one among them whose death may be assigned to one
period of the year more than another. But, he was beheaded
about the time of the Passover‚1 and not in the month of

December.
The most ancient of these festivals are those given

in the list of St. Gregory of Nyssa and in the Syriae
Menologion. The festival of St. Stephen goes back, as we
know> to a period considerably earlier than that of the
discovery of his tomb‚ which took place in 415, and gave
a great impulse to his commemoration. It is mentioned,
moreover, in the Apostolic Gonstitutions.2 All Western
calendars and liturgical books,3 from the fifth century

onwards, give this festival with its Eastern date.4
The festival of the 2¹7th of December was at first

other evangelists, and the festival having thus changed its character,
St. J ames would have been omitted}

1 Acts xii. 1-5.

² viii. 33. The day is not noted, but it could only have been on
the 26th of December.

³ The Leonian Sacramentary presents an apparent anomaly. In this
collection, which is in much disorder, the Masses in honour of St. Stephen,
the first martyr, instead of being placed at the 26th of December, are ranged
under the rubrio of the 2nd of August, along with the Pope‚ St. Stephen. It
is, douthess, because of the identity of the name of the Pope and the deaoon,
that the festival of the Invention of the body of St. Stephen (August 3) has
its origin. This festival 16 noted in the Hieronymian Martyrology‚ but not
in all the manuscripts. Its interpolation, therefore, could have only been
made 60 far back as the revision of Auxerre (circ. 595). No ancient
liturgica] work, Latin, Gallicam or Roman (except the Leonian Sacra-
mentary), contains a festival of the deacon, St. Stephen‚ in the month of
August. On the other hand, the festival of the ἆνακομιδὴ τῶν λειψάνων τοῦ
ἁγίου Στεφάνου appears on the 2nd of August in the Byzantine Calendars,
at least from the end of the tenth century (Martiuov, Annus Ecclesiasticus
Graeco-Stemma p. 192). It is also celebrated by the Armenians.

4 The Church of Constantinople transfers it to the 27th‚ for it assigns
the day after Ohristmas to the commemoration of the Blessed Virgin and

St. J oseph.
