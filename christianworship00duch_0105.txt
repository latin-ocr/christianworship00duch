THE MAss IN THE EAsr. 85

fixed in formularies.1 One of them was said at the moment
at' which the veil was withdrawn. There was in fact a
veil which, stretching across the altar, or even across the
whole apse, shut 0111 1116 view up to the moment when,
after the dismissa] of the catechumens and other non-
communicants, the celebration of the mysteries in the
presence of the initiated only was begun. This veil is
still in use among the Ghurches following the Oriental rite.
It is stretched before the central door of the iconostasis3
and is drawn and withdrawn at the times enjoined in
the ancient liturgies

We must take note of the recitation of the diptyohs
in this part of the Mass, The Syro—Byzantine liturgies
place it between the Kiss of Peace and the Preface, and
this custom is corroborated‚ at the beginning of the siXth
century, by Dionysius the Areopagite. It disappeared after-
wards at Constantinople. In the Alexandrine use, the
reading appears to have taken place, as it did in the Gallican

rite, after the Kiss of Peace.
From the Sursum Corda until 1116 end of the Mass the

rites, and subject-matter of the prayers‚ have remained almost
the same as they were at the beginning. Some diversities,
when we compare one use with another, appear in the
position assigned to certain parts, such as the Memento, the
Pater Noster, and the fraction of the bread, but hardly
any addition has been made to the primitive ritual. It
is necessary to draw attention, however, to the complica-
tion introduced in the ceremony of the fractio, and of the
comminatio, that is to say, the mixture of the consecrated
bread and wine. A characteristic feature of the Liturgy
of Constantinople was the infusion of a little hot water
into the chalice immediately before the Oommunion.

¹ Dionysius the Areopagite makes mention of the prayer said by
the bishop at the moment when the sacred oblations were placed upon
the altar: this is the ἐυχὴ τῆς προσκομιδῆς of the Byzantina Liturgy, the
oounterpart of the prayer Super oblata in the Roman Liturgy.
