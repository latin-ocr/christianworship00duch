136 CHRISTIAN wonsHIP: rrs omem AND EVOLUTION.

twelve months of the year, nine only are now remain-
ing, and the fourth, that of the month of April, is
incomplete. The loss of the first three months is much
to be regretted, for these contained the paschal 0010111011105,
which constitute the most interesting part of the Sacra-
mentarieS.

W'hat remains of the month of April is divided into
thirty-nine sections, comprising as manyl Masses in honour
of various martyrs. The martyrs are not mentioned by
name,2 so that the formularies may be used in commemora-
tion of any martyr. The month of May contains the Masses
of the Ascension, of Pentecost, and of the summer Ember
days. In the month of June we have the Masses in honour
of St. John Bapffist, SS. John and Paul, and the Apostles
Peter and Paul. In July the only festival given is that
of the Seven Brothers. These are followed by a considerable
number of Masses and prayers for divers occasions. In
the month of August we find a still greater number of
festivals—that of Pope St. Stephen (August 2), 11131 of
SS. Xystus, Felicissimus, and Agapitus (August 6), 11131
of St. Laurence (August 10), that of SS. Hippolytus and
Pontianus (August 13), and SS. Adauctus and Felix (August
30). In September we have the festivals of SS. Cornelius
and Cyprian (September 14), St. Euphemia (September 16),
of the dedication of the Church of St. Michael on the Via
Salaria (September 30), followed by the autumn Ember
days, the prayers used at ordinations and for the natale of
bishops, priests, and deacons, for the benediction of virgins,
and for marriages. There are no festivals in the month

¹ And even a few more. The numbers are sometimes incorrectly placed,
so that two Masses are given under one heading. ⁷

² These Masses were, however, drawn up at the outset for the anniver-
saries of specified martyr-s, of whom they originally contained the names.
But these have been suppressed‚ although two of them still remain,
those of St. Tiburtius (No. 6), and St. Gregory‚ or rather St. George

(No. 33).
