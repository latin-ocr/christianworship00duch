The volume, which is mutilated towards the end, breaks
off in a missa cotidiana Romami& of which only the first
prayer is given. With the exception of this latter, all
the formularies are arranged in the order followed in the
Gallican Mass, but many among them, especially the
Masses in honour of saints, are Roman formularieS.

This Missal contains a Mass in honour of St. Leger, in
which his relies are spoken of as being distributed through-

of the seventh century. In Mons. Delisle’s opinion, its
date should not be placed later than the beginning of
the following century.

8. The Missale Gallicanum Vetus}

This Sacramentary, which is of the same date as the
preceding, is known as No. 493 in the Palatine collection in
the Vatican Library. It is much mutilated. The frag-

script, but Tommasi, their first editor, arranged them as
they ought to be.

The first document we find in it is a Mass in honour
of St. Germain of Auxerre² which is followed by prayers
for the benediction of virgins and widows. After a break
come two Masses in Adventum Domini, one for Christmas

another gap. Further on, we find ourselves in the midst of
the rites of the catechumenate and of the Traditio symboli,
belonging to the Sunday before Easter, according to the
Gallican use. After a third gap follow the ceremonies for
