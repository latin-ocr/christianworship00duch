geographical. The bishops of the southern slopes of the
Lebanon were nearer to Caesarea than to Antioch; they
therefore went to Caesarea. It is also noticeable that in
their synodal letter, of which Eusebius has preserved a
fragment, they state that they are in the habit of referring
to the Bishop of Alexandria for fixing the date for keeping
Easter. There is no trace of any relations with the
metropolitan see of Syria.

This see, on the other hand, extended its influence beyond
the boundaries of the province of Syria. Towards the end
of the second century we find Sarapion, Bishop of Antioch,
exercising his pastoral authority at 111108803,1 a town situated
in Cilicia. According to the tradition of the Church of
Edessa,2 this same Sarapion had ordained Palouth, third
occupant of the Mesopotamian see. In the time of
· Sarapion and Palouth, however, the town of Edessa had
not yet become part of the Roman Empire.

In Asia Minor, about the middle of the third century, we
find a Oouncil at Iconium, at which bishops of wholly un-
connected provinces—Cappadocia, Galatia, Cilicia, and others
—are gathered together?

We have, on the whole, as yet, no traces of a tendency to
shape the ecclesiastical on the model of the civil provinces.
But there is here and there a local ecclesiastical grouping
either around the natural metropolitan sees or into regiona]
councils embracing more or less extensive areas, according
