ORDINATION. 343

chiefly in works of charity and hospitality, but they had
also some liturgical functions to perform in the adminis-
tration of baptism and at the agapes. The service of the
altar was reserved for the deacons‚ and we find no instance
(except as an abuse) of the deaconesses having had any
share in it.

The diaconate of women maintained an existence down
to the fifth or sixth century. By that time the baptism
of adults had become more and more exceptional, and
the deaeonesses had thus no longer the opportunity of
exercising ⁴their liturgical functions; besides which monas-
teries for women gradually began 10 attract within their
walls such holy persons as lived in that age of the “re-
ligious ’⁷ life. There was therefore less need of this special
and somewhat exceptional order, and as early as the
middle of the third century we find the deaconesses at
Rome taking a place in the canon, that is to say, in the
group of persons assisted by the Ohurch‚ and not among
the cleryy properly so called.1

While the diaconate of women thus declined in im-
portame, that of men developed rapidly. The functions
of the deacons were distributed among the grades of a
more or less complicated hierarchy. In the East there
were only two degrees, that of deacon and that of sub-

attendants. The reading of the sacred books in meetings
for worship had at first been entrusted to any person whom
the president thought fit to appoint. It was soon raised
to an office, and from the end of the second century we
note the existence of lector-3, who are also ranked among
