TRANSLATOR’S NOTE TO PAGE 272.

MONSEIGNEUR Dnonssxm has expressed a wish that I should call attention
to some Greek verses ou page 3 of Mr. W. Ε. Crum's Ooptc'c Ostraca
(special extra publication ot* the Egypt Exploration Fund, 1902), a work
whichvhad not been published when Monseigneur Duehesne sent to press
the third French edition of the present volume.

These verses occur on an ostracon discovered, with numerous others, by
Dr. Naville, among the ruins of the Coptic Monastery which had been built
on the upper terr-ace of the Temple of Hatasu at Der el-Bahri. The Rev.
F. E. Brightman describes these lines as ‘⁶ approximately an Eastern form
of the Ave Maria,” to be ‘⁶ sung in the service, like the Psalm and Alleluia,
before the Gospel and the Aspasmos at the Kiss of Peace.'' They are
“apparently for a feast of the Blesscd Virgiu Mary, perhaps the Purifica-
tion.'' Mr. Crum thinks the Coptic Convent of Der el—Bahri was the
Monastery of St. Phoebammon, and that the date of the ostracon, from the
handwriting‚ is about 600 ΑΛ). The Rev. F. E. Brightman, ou liturgica]
grounds, confirms Mr. Crum’s opinion as to the date.

The verses in point are as follows :—

TRANsLATION.—“ Hail, Mary, endued with grace: the Lord is with thee ε

blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, because
thou didst conceive Christ, the Son of God, the Redeemcr of our souls.⁷’
