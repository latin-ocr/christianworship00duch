124 CHRISTIAN woRsmP: 115 omem AND EVOLUTION-

516110115 01 1116 Thursdays are not older than Gregory 11.
(715-731), whereas the statione of Ash Wednesday and the
following days, up to the First Sunday in Lent, are more
ancient, but at the same time still later than 81. Gregory.
Another addition is evident in the station of J anuary lst,

given as acl St. Mariam ad Martyres, since this Church‚ ἢ

that is, the Pantheon, was not consecrated 101· Christian
worship until the time of Pope Boniface IV. (608-615).
Its dedication is indicated on May 13111, 50 that here
again we have a festival posterior to 81. Gregory. The
same applies 10 1116 dedication 01 81. Nicomede, on June
151, this Ohurch having been consecrated under Boniface V.
(619-625). The Ohurches 01 81. Adrian, St. Andrew near
the Lateran, St. Lucy‚ 81. George‚ St. Theodore, and St.
Apollinaris, mentioned as stational Churches, are, 1116
three first 01 the time 01 Honorius (625—638), the others
probably later. Finally, the festival 01 Pope St. Leo,
indicated on June 28111, 15 1116 anniversary, not 01 1115
death, but 01 1116 translation 01 1115 161105 under Sergius1
(687-701).

These are the only modifications that the information
at our disposal has enabled us to verify. But it 15 possible
there may be many others which have escaped us. Any
text or rite which appears in this book, but does not figure
in any earlier document, may, it 15 11116, go back 130 6 remote
antiquity; but it may, with equal possibility, date merely
from the eighth century. In these circumstances, and
especially when there is a question 01 1116 date 01 6 text or
rite, it would be hazardous to cite the Gregorian Sacra-
mentary as 611 authority belonging to the end 01 1116 sixth

¹ It should also be noted that on the 29th of July we find under the
rubrio SS. Felicis, Simplicii, Faustini et Beatricz's, a Mass in honour of 81.
Felix only. This suggests that the translation of the three other martyre
had already taken place. It occurred under Leo II. (682-683).
