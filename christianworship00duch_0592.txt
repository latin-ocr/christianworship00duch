was foretold which was not wholly fulfilled. Prayers also suit-
able to the day are interspersed throughout. The emotion shown
and the mourning by all the people at every lesson and prayer is
wonderful 3 for there is none, either great or small, who, on that
day during those three hours, does not lament more than can be

service at the ninth hour, however, is not held on the Sabbath,
but the Paschal vigils are prepared in the great church, the
Martyrium. The Paschal vigils are kept as with us, with this
