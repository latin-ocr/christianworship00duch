being at the same time a church, an episcopal resideme,
a refectory, a dispensary‚ and an almshouse. The place
specially chosen for worship, however, assumed from an
early date a special importance. The other parts of the
building came gradually to be detached, and participated
in no respect in its sacred character. The domus ecclesiae
became the domus Dei, the place where Christians met the

The idea of associating a particular solemnity with the
taking possession of one of these sacred buildings was too
natural to be overlooked, and we find, consequently, an
expression of it at an early date. Immediately after the
persecution of Diocletian we have notices of the dedication of
churches performed with a certain degree of pomp. Eusebius
describes that of Tyre, which was celebrated in the year
314. A special ritual did not yet exist. The neighbouring
bishops were called together, and an immense concourse
of people assembled‚ giving solemnity to the first cele-
bration of the holy mysteries. Addresses bearing on the
subject were delivered. Eusebius, who was elected to
deliver the discourse at the dedication of the Church of
Tyre, did not neglect to insert in his history his address
on this occasion.

The Church of Tyre was a city church, or rather the
church par excellence, the Cathedral of Tyre. It is possible
that there may have been none other there at the time of
its inauguration. In such great cities as Rome, Alex-
andria, and Carthage, there were at an early date several
churches, a single one being insufficient to contain the
whole Christian population. These churches had their own
special priests, but they were none the less considered
