74 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

The Armenian use is represented by only a single text, of
which the oldest attestation as to its details is a commentary
of the tenth century.l The Armenian Church, in 491, de-'
nounced the Gouncil of Chalcedon, at a time when none
of the official Churches of the Greek Empire accepted it.
When the latter came into communion with Rome (519),
and embraced the saith of Chalcedon, they made several
attempts to induce the Armenians to do the same. But
their efforts were in vain—in place of reconciling them
they only intensified the schism, which made itself par-
ticularly noticeable in the matter of ritual.2

In the Middle Ages, many Armenians, who had been
driven out of their country by various invasions, emigrated
into Persia, Syria, Asia Minor, and even as far as Hungary
and Poland. In this dispersim, which was similar to the
Jewish Diaspom, they preserved their language, nationality‚
and ritual. Their chief ecclesiastica] superior has always
been, theoretically, the Catholicos of Etchmiadzin, but they
have, as a matter of fact, in various countries, an organisa-
tion independent of this theoretical authority, placed at the
present time under the influence of Russia. During the last
century many of them have been received into communion
with the Roman Church. Those in Turkey have at their
head a national patriarch (Patriarch of Cilicia), residing at

Constantinople. In Austria they are under the Armenian
Archbishop of Leopol.3

their wine without any admixture of water. They did not admit the
festival of Ohristmas into their calendar.

³ It is clear that neither the Armenian—Gregorian Patriarchs of Turkey,
nor the Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, can be placed on the same footing
as the representatives of the four Greek patriarchates The Catholicos
of Etchmiadzin‚ whose jurisdiction in theory extends over the whole

Armenian nation, has a superior title to theirs. But, according to the
