THE CHRISTIAN FESTIVALS. 279

in the West up to the twelfth century at least. I have
been a witness of this custom among the orthodox Greeks
in Epirus, and also among the Mahometans.

The Natale Pam· de Oathedm was the subJ‘ect of
another coincidence, of which the inconvenience came
at length to be recognised. It occurred often in Lent.
In countries observing the Gallican rite, where Lenten
observance was considered incompatible with the honour-
ing of 6611116,1 1116 difficulty was avoided by holding the
festival on an earlier date. The liturgical books place
it in the month of January‚ alongside the festival of
the Blessed Virgin, which was celebrated on the 18111
of that 111011111.2 The Hieronymian Martyrology, in its
Auxerre recension, is more precise. It gives 1116 18111
of January as the day of the festival of the Chair of
St. Peter at Rome. The Auxerre editor was accommodating
himself here 10 the custom of his country, but as the text
before him noted a Natale S. Petri de Ccctlwdo'a on the
22nd of February, the idea occurred to him of preserving
the two commemorations by attributing the latter 10
Α11110011, 6 666 which was believed 10 have been also
occupied by the prince of the apostles.

This combination was 1101 61 first received with favour.

ancl the festival of the Oatheclrcc, and places three between the latter and
Lent. The Sacramentary of Bobbio puts the festival of the Gatlzedrcc
immediately before that of the Virgin (January 18>3 as for the Missale
Gothicum, it intercalates between the festival of the Gathedrcc and that of the
Virgin 11166666 for St. Agnes (January 21), st. Cecilia (November 22),
St. Clement (November 23), St. Saturninus (November 29), St. Andrew
(November 30), St. Eulalia (December 10), and for the Conversion of
St. Paul (January 25). It is clear from this that it does not follow here
the order of the calendar, and that it cannot consequently be adduoed as
a witness against the unanimity of the other documents.
