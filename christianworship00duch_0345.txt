OEREMONIES or GHRISTIAN INITIATioN. 321

The officiating priest first recited a collective prayer,
which was preceded by a sornewhat lengthy invitatory of
the usual Gallican type.l The following is one of the
formularies which have been preserved. :—

Deum immortalium munerum et salutarium gratiarum, Fratres dilec-
tissimi, concordi mente et humili oratione poscamus, ut per Verbum,
Sapientiam et Virtutem suam, dominum nostrum J esum Christum Filium
suum, concurrenti ad baptismum salutarem plebi suae gratiam novae
regenerationis indulgeat3 atque accessus hinc penitus malignae conta-
gionis avertens infundat vitali lavacro Spiritum suum sanctum ut dum
sitiens fidem populus aquas salutares ingreditur, vere, ut scriptum est, per
aquam et Spiritum sanctum renascatur, et consepultus in lavacro Redemp-
tori suo, in similitudinem sacri divinique mysterii, cui commoritur per
baptismum eidem conresurgat in regno.

Benedic, Domine, hanc aquam salutaris et sanctifica eam, omnipotens
Trinitas, qui humanum genus formare creareque jussisti, quique etiam
dedisti nobis per tui baptismatis mysterium 2 gratiam renascendi. Respice

filled during the night of Easter Eve. One of these was in Sicily, and
is mentioned by Paschasinus, Bishop of Lilyboeum, in a letter addressed
to Pope St. Leo (Ballerini, vol. i. p. 607); there was another at Marcelliana,
near Consilinum, in Lucania (Cassiodorus, Vara, viii. 33); and others in
Asia Minor (Moschus, Prat. Spin, 214, 215). The most celebrated was that
of Osset [Osset Constantia,? Salteras,—TR.]‚ near Sevssle, in Spain, frequently
mentioned by Gregory of Tours (Hist. Fon, v. 17; vi. 43; Glor. Mart„
23, 243 cf. Ildefonsus, De Baptismo, 105, 106). He was careful to ask,
in those years when there was uncertainty as to the date when Easter
should fall, whether the miraculous font had filled itself on the day on
which he had kept the festival.

¹ This is one of the two given in the Missale Gallicanum. The other
has a Gallican invitatory, followed by the Roman prayer quoted on p. 311.
In the Missale Gothicum, the invitatory is so badly copied that it is
unintelligible. After the sentence Stcwztes, fratres karissimi, super ripam
vitrei fontis, come several words which have no sense whatever, then the
text continues: Naviqmztes pulsent mare novum non vzrqa sed cruce, non
tactu secl sensu, non baculo sed sacramento. Locus quidem parvus sed qratia
plenae, etc. The formulary of the Bobbio Sacramentary has been curiously

cut out of the Roman rite. The Mozarabic Missa] does not contain any
formulary of this kind.
