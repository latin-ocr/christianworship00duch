EocLEfflASTICAL AREAs. 5

Safeguarded outwardly by their privileges, provided with
a recognised organisation, the Jewish communities of Greek-
speaking countries were not attached to each other by any
external bond. Their connection with the politica] authorities
at Jerusalem was never manifest, not even during the
short period in which the Maccabees made the Holy City
the capital of a small independent kingdom. But the Jews
felt themselves to be closely united together by the strongest
ties,—-by a common religion, and by a keen patriotic feeling,
which, although uninfluenced for the moment by any political
hopes, was still fostered by mysterious aspirations. Jerusalem,
whatever her tempora] rulers might be, always remained the
ideal centre, the lodestar of the whole Jewish Dispersion.
The ties which bound them to her were the annual tribute
of the half—shekel, which every Israelite paid to the Temple
of the Lord, and the pilgrimage thither, which every J ew
had to make at least once in his lifetime.

In contradistinction to the Holy City, Rome assumed in
the Jewish mind, before long, the position of metropolis of
the pagan world. The Greek kingdoms having passed away,
and the ancient Greek cities having been reduced to insigni-
ficance, it was to the Italian capital that the spirit of Hel-
lenism turned. The opposition between these centres soon
manifested itself. From the time of the persecutions of
Epiphanes onward, the Jewish race had been swayed by an
undercurrent of hatred against Greek paganism—against the
whole Hellenistic spirit, institutions, art, and religion. Jeru-
salem was the source from whence this undercurrent flowed.
Here it was felt, and here it was preached, that there could
be no truce between the empire of falsehood and evil, which
from this time sorvvard had its throne in the great Babylon
of the West, and the kingdom of God, which the Messiah
was shortly to set up in the Holy Oity of David.

We know how these hopes were frustrated.v An open
struggle at length broke out under the shadow of the Temple
