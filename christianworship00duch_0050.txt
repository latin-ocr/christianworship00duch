gather round him a council of sixty bishops‚1 who were mainly
Italians from Southern Italy, for, in the North, there were,
until the fourth century, very few episcopal 6666.2 Italy was
not, as yet, divided into provinces, as the division did not
take place till the end of the third century. By that time
things had already taken definite shape. The Pope exercised
his authority as superior, without any intermediary, over
all the bishops of the peninsula. When the Italian islands
were brought into connection with the suburbicarian diocese,
their bishops naturally formed part of this group. Those of
Caralis and Syracuse succeeded in obtaining some special
honours for their sees, but that was all. The Pope remained
the only real metropolitan of the Italian peninsula and its
islands.

I have already spoken of ecclesiastical centralisation in
Africa. There, the primacy of Carthage did not prevent a
certain provincial grouping of the episcopate around the
senior bishop of each province. In the African councils, of
which we have so large a number, it is always necessary to
distinguish between those that are provincial only and those
that are general, convoked and presided over by the Bishop
of Carthage. But these different groupings are merely the
outcome 01 the organisation of 0116 large united and vigor-
ously active body. No ecclesiastical group is more clearly
specialised than that of North Africa, just as no region 01 the
Empire is more clearly isolated from the rest by its natural
boundaries.

In Southern Italy, and specially in Africa, the episcopal
sees were very numerous. The same cannot be said 01 the
rest 01 Western Christendom. In the part of Italy watered

2 The only sees that have any serious claim to an antiquity prior to the
fourth century are those of Ravenna (Classis), Milan, Aquileia, Brescia, and
Verona. The two first appear to have been founded about the beginning of
the third century, or even a little earlier.
