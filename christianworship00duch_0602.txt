57 6 APPENDIX.

Anastasis, but only the neophytes and the faithful, who wish to
hear concerning the mysterieS‚ enter there, and the doors are
shut lest any catechumen should draw near. And while the
Bishop discusses and sets forth each point, the voices of those
who applaud are so Ioud that they can be heard outside the
chureh. And truly the mysteries are so unfoldecl that there is
no one unmoved at the things that he hears to be so explained.

Now, forasmueh as in that province some of the people know
both Greek and Syriae, while some know Greek alone and others
only Syria03 and because the Bishop‚ although he knows Syriae,
yet always speaks Greek, and never Syriae, there is always a
Priest standing by who, when the Bishop speaks Greek, inter-
prets into Syriae, that all may understand what is being taught.
And because all the lessons that are read in the chureh must be
read in Greek, some one always stands by who interprets them
into Syriae, for the people's sake, that they may always be edified.
Moreover, the Latins here, who understand neither Syriae nor
Greek, in order that they be not disappointed, have (all things)
explained to them, for there are other brothers and sisters
knowing both Greek and Latin, who translate into Latin for
them. But what is above all things very pleasant and. admirable
here, is that the hymnS, the antiphons, and the lessons, as well
as the prayers which the Bishop sayS, always have suitable
and fitting references, both to the day that is being celebrated
and also to the place where the celebration is being made.

DED1CAT10N or OHUReHEs.

These are called the days of Dedication when the holy chureh
which is in Golgotha, and which they call the Martyrium, was
consecrated to G0d; the holy chureh also which is at the
Anastasis, that is, in the place where the Lord rose after His
Passion‚ was consecrated to God on that day. The dedication
of these holy ehurehes is therefore celebrated with the highest
honour, and also because the Oross of the Lord was found on this
same day. And it was so ordained that, when the holy ehurehes
