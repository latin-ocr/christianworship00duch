306 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: irs ORIGIN ΛΝΒ EVOLurroN.

Emitte, quaesumus Domine, Spiritum sanctum Paraclitum de caelis
in hanc pinguedinem olei, quam de viridi ligno producere dignatus es ad
refectionem mentis et corporis; et tua sancta benedictione sit omni
ungenti, gustanti, tangenti, tutamentum mentis et corporis, animae et
spiritus, ad evacuandos omnes dolores, omnem infirmitatem, omnem
aegritudinem mentis et corporis, unde unxisti sacerdotes, reges et
prophetas et martyres, chrisma tuum perfectum a te, Domine, bene-
dictum, permanens in visceribus nostris in nomine Domini nostri Jesu

Christi.

The blessing being ended, the bishop proceeded with
the Mass from the Per quem haec omma, etc„ at the end
of the Oanon.1 The deacons returned the vessels of cil to
the place whence they had brought them. Those that had
not been brought to the altar were blessed where they
stood on the balustrade‚ by either bishops or priests, who
made use of the formulary employed by the Pope.

The consecration of the greater vessels took place im-
mediately after the communion of the Pope and before
that of the clergy and congregation. The deacons brought
back to the altar the paten and chalice, and spread over
them 3 white linen cloth. The acolytes who held the
scyphi containing the wine sor the communion of the
faithful, covered these in the same manner. The sub-
deacons, having brought the ampullae to the archdeacon
and to one of his colleagues, the archdeacon took the one
containing the fragrant 011 and presented it to the Pope.
The Pope, having breathed thrice upon it, signed it with
the sign of the cross, saying, Iu uomina Putris et Fuit
et Spiritus suncti. He then, having saluted the congre-
gation as at the Preface, with the Sursum Corda and the
Gratias ccyccmus, recited the following eucharistic prayer :—

Vere dignum . . . aeterne Deus, qui in principio, inter caetera boni-
tatis et pietatis tuae munera, terram producere fructifera ligna jussisti,
