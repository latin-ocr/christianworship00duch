90 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

ξ 2.-01113111 or THE GALLIGAN Usu.

Assuming that the domain cf the Gallican Liturgy extended
up to the metropolitan diocese of the rope, embracing North
ltaly, or, at the least, the metropolitan diocese of Milan, the
way becomes open for the solution of an obscure and conten-
tious question : that of the origin of the Gallican Liturgy.

The English liturgiologists, who have been much occu-

and style, and sometimes in tenor. It departs widely from
those simple and still unfixed forms which can be definitely

liturgy of the second century. Its development corresponds'
at the earliest with the condition of things in the fourth

Lyons was almost non-existent. This city, after the new
