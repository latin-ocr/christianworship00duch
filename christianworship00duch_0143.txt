after the Ordinary of the Mass, or are placed at the end of
the Sacramentary.

The second part, by far the most important, is the main
part of the Sacramentary. As Ι have said, it contains only
the Masses for great festivals and solemn stations. There
are none for the ordinary Sundays between the Epiphany
and Lent and from the octave of Easter to Advent. Advent
with Christmastide, Lent with Easter Week, Ascension Day,
Whitsunday‚ and Ember days are all that is represented by
the proprium de tempore of later Missals. The festivals
of saints which are on fixed days are distributed more or
less systematically among the movable feasts, but in such
a way that Lent and Easter Week form an uninterrupted
series

The place of the station is always expressly indicated,
unless the name of the saint alone is sufficient to designate
the Church at which the festival was held. For instance, it
was not deemed necessary to say where the station was on
the days of St. Marcellus, St. Agnes, St. Sylvester‚ etc. But
for the days of Lent, for the festival of the Holy Innocents‚
and for that of St. Felix of Nola, the Church is indicated.
There are sometimes even two indications when the station
is preceded by a general procession3 in that case the
Church is denoted from which the procession starts, and
that also wherein Mass is celebrated. Similar indications
are given when there are several stations on the same day,
or several stopping-places in a procession, as, for instance,
at the festival of Ohristmas, on the day of the Greater Litany‚
and at vespers in Easter Week.

We have here, in the main, a book drawn up, not for the
Roman use in general, applicable to any country whatever,
but for the Roman use as observed in Rome. Moreover,
it is an essentially stational Sacramentary, which could
hardly have been used unless on festivals and days of solemn
