CHAPTER XII.
THE DEDIOATION or CHURCHES.

ᾗ L—-BUILDINGS CONSECRATED To CHRISTIAN Worzsfflr.

THE primitive churches were ordinary houses suited
specially for Christian worship, or rather for all the
services of the Christian community. The houses of that
period were very easily adapted to this purpose. They
comprised, as a rule, an entrance from the public road, a
courtyard surrounded by a colonnade (atrium), and at the
back another court, or enclosed hall, a bath-room, living-
rooms, cellars, and offices of all kinds, arranged around the
inside courtyards. This kind of building supplied what
was required for the accommodatiori of the various classes
of persons of which the Christian meetings were composed,
namely, the catechumens, the faithful, and the penitents.
It also provided a dwelling for the bishop and the clergy
who assisted him in his office, and could be used as a
depository for papers, books, and the sacred vessels, and
as a storehouse for the clothing, bedding, and provisions
for the use of the poor and strangers. A domus ecclesiae
in those early times comprised all that we have just
enumerated.l It was a somewhat complicated institution,
