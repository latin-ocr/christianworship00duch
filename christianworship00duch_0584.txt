1. Saturdccy before Palm Sanday.———Stati0n at Bethany.

Now when the seventh week has come, that is, when two
weeks, including the seventh‚ are left before Easter, everything
is done 011 each day as in the weeks that are past, except that
the vigils of the sixth weekday, which were kept in the Anastasis
during the first six weeks, are, in the seventh Week, kept in
