φωτιζόμενοι, took place universally during Lenis} On a
given day the candidates were solemnly taught the symbol
of the Christian saith, and at Rome this tradition of the
symbol was accompanied by the tradition of the Gospel
and the Lord’s Prayer.

Immediately before their baptism (except in Spain,
and perhaps in Gaul) the candidates received the pre-
paratory anointing with the signing of the cross upon
the organs of sense, particularly on the ears and mouth.
At Rome the signing of the organs of sense is made with
saliva, whereas in the East, and in the countries observing
the Gallican use, the same oil is employed with which
the body is anointed.2 In all Latin countries this ceremony
precedes the renunciation of the devil3 in all others it
immediately follows it.

The threefold renunciation of Satan, or the abjuration
of paganism, is also common to all the rites. Everywhere‚
except 'm Galh‘can countries‚ it is followed by the recitation
of the Creed,3 in which the candidate expresses his adherence
to his new Master, J esus Christ.

The last profession of faith, under the form of a reply
to a triple interrogation, is of universal use. So is also
the triple immersion, except in Spain, where immersion
took place only once. A special peculiarity is found in
Gaul and North Italy [and in Ireland—TR.] in the washing
of the feet after baptism.

¹ It is indeed, in all probability, that from this same preparation Lent
derived its origin. See supra, p. 242.

²² At Alexandria, the Unction and the Effeta are separated. The Effeta
took place, as at Rome, before the Easter vigil, after the last exorcism.
Perhaps saliva was used, but at any rate no mention is made of the use
of oil. This is to be gathered from an ancient Egyptian ritual, of which a
German version has been published, together with the canons of Hippolytus,
by Herr H. Achelis, in Teste und Untersuchwzqen, vol. vi. p. 93.

³ In the East there are two “redditions'⁷ of the Oreed (see p. 329):
one before the day of the renunciation, the other immediately after that
ceremony. The Gallican rite has retained the first of these only.
