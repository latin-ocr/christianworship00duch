154 oHRIsTIAN WORSHIP: rrs omem AND EVOLUTION.

To this fragment of a Sacramentary should be added a few
palimpsest leaves published by Peyron, Mai, and Bunsen.
The fragments of Mai and Peyron appear to have belonged
to the same manuscript in the Ambrosian Lilorary.1 Those
of Bunsen vvere deciphered from a manuscript at St. Gall?
All these remains are of a well-marked Gallican character.
We cannot say the same of a fragment more recently
published by Herr Bickell from a manuscript at Cambridge.3
It contains part of a Christmas Mass, composed almost
entirely of Roman prayers.

10. The Leetztonary of luxeuil.

This manuscript, numbered 9427 in the Bibliotheque
Nationale, contains the lections of the Mass for the
ecclesiastical year. It is written in minuscules of the
seventh century. Mabillon found it at the Abbey of
Luxeuil, and published it in his De Lituryz'a Gallicana.
He did not give the complete text, as he did not consider
it necessary to reproduce, in their entirety, the portions
known from other sources. He therefore prints merely
the beginning and end of each lection, with the necessary
references, but he gives the whole of the rubrics, which
are of much greater importance.

The Lectionary of Luxeuil is a purely Gallican book,
