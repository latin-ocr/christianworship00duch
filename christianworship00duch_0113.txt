THE TWO LITURGIOAL USEs OF THE LATIN WEST. 93

Gallican Liturgy had reached that stage 01 development
which it possessed when it spread throughout the West,
and at the very moment when the West experienced the
need of a definitely fixed liturgy.

This is not all. It is well known by every one that the
Gallican Liturgy, in the features which distinguish it from
the Roman 1156, betrays all the characteristics of the Eastern
liturgies. We shall 566, further on, that some of its formu-
laries 616 10 106 found word for word in the Greek texts which
were in use in the Churches of the Syro-Byzantine rite either
in the fourth century or somewhat later. This close resem-

putting aside the presence of the 001111 61 Μ11611, and the
numerous assemblies of Oriental bishops which were held
there, we have to take into account 6 further fact 01 grave

After the defeat of the Arianising party which, 65 far as the
West was concerned, followed closely upon the breaking up
of this council, Auxentius maintained his position, and
remained fifteen years in his see, notwithstanding the efforts
made to dislodge him. This would seem to indicate that he
had a strength of mind beyond the common. We can readily
