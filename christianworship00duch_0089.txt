many details with regard to the liturgy in the Monophysite
Ghurches using the Syriae language.1

2. Mesopotamia and Persia.

There is no doubt that the Ohurches of Mesopotamia
and Persia were founded by missionaries who came
from Antioch. But the differenee of language and of
political allegiance in these regions soon gave a special
feature to these Ohurches‚ and did not fail to have an
influence on their liturgical uses. It is somewhat diffi-
cult to differentiate here between Edessa and Seleucia-
Ctesiphon.

The Nestorian communities of the ancient Sassanid
kingdom have preserved liturgies‚ the original proveozance
of which may be either of these two metropolitan cities.
At the close of the fifth century the Nestorians of Edessa
overran Persia, and there is no reason to suppose that
they did not carry thither many of their country's 0115101115.
However this may be, the Nestorian liturgies may be
considered 10 represent the type adopted in 1110 00111111105
beyond the Euphrates, where the liturgical language was
exclusively Syriae. We must at the present time dis-
tinguish between the Nestorians properly so called, who
have kept themselves together with their national patriarch
in the mountains of Κ11101151011,2 and the Uniat or Chaldean
Nestorians‚ who have at their head a Catholic Patriarch
residing at Mossul. These two dignitaries, who bear the
title of Patriarchs of Babylon, are representatives of the
succession of the ancient Oatlzolicos of Seleucia.3

² His residence is at Kochanes, near Julamerk, a place situated on the
Zab, in the mountains 10 1110 north of Mossul, a short distance from the
Persian frontier.

⁸ The Jacobites have also in these countries their own particular
organisation, presided over by a ‘⁶ Maphrian.⁷’
