LITUReroAL FORMULARIES AND BooKs. 109

Oremus‚ dilectissimi nobis in primis pro Ecclesia sancta Dei; ut eam
Deus et Dominus pacificare, adunare et custodire dignetur per universum
orbem terrarum, subiciens ei principatus et potestates, detque nobis
tranquillam et quietam vitam degentibus glorificare Deum Patrem
omnipotentem. Oremus!

Adnuntia& diaconus: Flectamus genua!

Iterum dicit.- Levate!

Omnipotens, sempiterne, Deus, qui gloriam tuam omnibus¹ in Christo
gentibus revelasti, custodi opera misericordiae tuae, ut Ecclesia tua toto
orbe diffusa stabili fide in confessione tui nominis perseveret. Per
[eumdem Christum, etc.]

We must also recall in this connection the Orate, ffimtres,
of the Mass. The Roman invitatory is more frequently
confined to the simpler oremus! Something like this must
have also been in use in the Gallican rituaL for many
prayers therein have no elaborate invitatories, and it is
difficult to believe that they were not preceded by any
announcement.

The Roman formularies, Fleetccmus flamia, Lebaba oon-
tain, both in books and usage, the only trace of what was
at one time the essentia] element in this form of prayer,
viz, the supplicatim] offered up in silence and in a
prescribed attitude.

The Euchariscic prayer was the most solemn form of
all. It was said by the officiating minister alone, and in
the name of all; the congregation had merely to listen, to
join in it mentally‚ and to make the response Amen at the
end. Its general subject-matter is thanksgiving. In the
Roman ritual, and indeed in all others, it began always in
the same way: “It is truly meet, right, and salutary to
render thanks to Thee‚ at all times and in all places, holy
Lord, Father Almighty, eternal G0d1”
