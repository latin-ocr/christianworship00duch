THE NUPTIAL BLEserG. 433

Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus, iteratis precibus
te supplices exoramus pro quibus apud te supplicator est Christus,
conjunctiones famulorum tuorum fovere digneris, benedictiones tuas
excipere mereantur, et filiorum successibus fecundentur. Nuptias eorum
sicuti primi hominis confirmare dignare; avertantur ab eis inimici onmes
insidiae, ut sanctitatem Patrum etiam in ipso conjugio imitentur, qui
providentia tua, Domine, conjungi meruerunt.

It is interesting to note that the nuptial ritual de-
scribed by Pope Nicolas is neither more nor less than
the ancient Roman marriage rite, without the sacrifice,
or rather with the substitution of the Mass for the
pagan sacrifice. The Romans themselves distinguished
between the preliminary engagement or betrothal and
the nuptial ceremony proper. Their rite began by the
mutual engagement, which was contracted by both parties
in presence of each other in a set form of words. This
engagement was marked by the delivery of the ring, or
subarrhati0; then followed the drawing up of the marriage
contract, accompanied by gifts from the bridegroom to
the bride. All this took place in the presence of the
friends of the family, who were afterwards entertained
at a banquet.

On the morning of the marriage the gods were at first
consulted by the taking of auspices. At a later date the
divination of the haruspex, which presupposed a sacrifice,
was substituted for the auspices. On the previous evening
the woman had laid aside her maiden dress and had assumed
the garments of a bride. Her head was covered with the
flammeum, or red—coloured veil, which, with the exception
of the colour‚ was the same as that worn by all married
women. It is from this obnubilatio eapitis that the terme
nubere, nuptiae, nuptia& are derived. The bride's hair was
divided into six plaits, and her head crowned with flowers
which she herself had gathered. A similar fioral crown

was also worn by the bridegroom.
