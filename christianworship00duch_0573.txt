ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THE PORTION OF
THE PEREGRINA TIO ETHERIAE 1 IN THE
APPENDIX.2

I.

DAILY Officiis.
1. Matius.

Now that your affection may know what is the order of Ser-vice
day by day in the Holy Places, I must inform you, for J] know
that you would willingly have this knowledge. Every day
before cockcrow all the doors of the Anastasis are opened, and
all the Monks and Virgins, as they call them here, go thither,
and not they alone, but lay people also, both men and women,
who desire to begin their vigil early. And from that hour to

daybreak hymns are said and psalms are sung responsively, and
antiphons in like manner 3 and prayer is made after each of the
hymns. For Priests, Deaeons, and Monks in twos or threes take

MSS. of the Letter of Valerius. That of the Escurial gives Eiheria; that

Bouvy, in two articles contributed to the Revue Auqust. (2e annee, 1903, No.
21, and 3e ann6e, 1904, No. 22), contends with great plausibility that the
correct form is Eucheria. He conjectures the lady to have been the daughter
of Flavius Eucherius, Consul at Constantinople in 381, and uncle to Theodosius
the Great. The authoress of the Pereqrinatio was thus the first cousin of the
Em eror.

‘PThis translation is added by request. It should be noted that the
word missa in the text is translated “Dismissal’' throughout, although it
must on some occasions have meant ‘⁶ Mass.’' For the ambiguity of the mean-
ing attached to missa, see the author’s introduction to the text, p, 491. In
the Mozarabie use in Spain it appears to have been employed in the sense of
“ Office ’' or “ Service '' down to the eleventh century. See Le Liber ominum,
published by Dom. Fe‘rotin (Firmin-Didot, Paris, 1904), pp. 45, 65, 68, etc.
