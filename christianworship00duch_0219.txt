'St-2. Germain is ‘che only writer who mentions the

chanbing of the Trisagion as accompanying ‘ohe procession
of the Gospel, both on going and returning. But in all
‘ohe Latin liburgies the exclamation by the congregation,
Gloria tibi Domine, is prescribed as the response 'co the
announcement of the Gospel lection: Lectio sancti Evanqeliz·

5. The H omily.

GERMAIN z Homiliae autem sanctorum qaae loquatur pro
sola praedicatione ponuntur, ut quicqaid Propheta, Apostolus
vel Evanyeliam mandavit, hoo doctor vel pastor Ecclesiae
aperiiori sermone populo praedicet, ita arte temperans ut oiec
rusticitas sapientes offendat, nec honesta loqaaciias obscura
rusticis fiat.

The custom of having the Homily after the Gospel was
bether observed in Gaul than in Rome. The priests, as
well as the bishops, were accustomed to preach. This
usage is denounced by Pope Celesbine in a letter which
he addressed ‘no the Bishops of Provence.1 Bur instead
of being abolished on thar account, it was confirmed and
extended even to rura] parishes by the second Council of
Vaison (529). This council was the Provincial Couneil
of the Metropolis of Aries, and ib is well known what] a
zealous advocate of preaching its bishop‚ St. Caesarius
of Aries, was. His homilies have exacffly the qualibies
of elearness and simplicity which St. Germain claims for

them.2
