aristocracy, who largely availed themselves of it.

If a catechumen was desirous of completing his initia-
tion, and the rulers of the Church deemed him worthy to
receive baptism, he passed into the category of the elect, or
competens} At the beginning of Lent the names of those
who were to be baptised on Easter Eve were written down.
During these solemn forty days they were obliged to be
present frequently at chureh, in order to undergo exorcisms
and to hear preparatory instruction on baptism.

It was at Easter, in fact, that baptism was ordinarily
administered, and that, too, from the earliest times.2 The
vigil of Easter Sunday was devoted to this ceremony. If
this did not allow sufficient time of probation, or if the
neophyte for any reason could not participate in the initia—
tion on this day, it was postponed to a later date in Easter-
tide. The last day for this purpose, that of Pentecost,
as much on account of its being the last as for its own
special solemnity, came soon to be regarded as a second
baptismal festival.

The Roman Church restricted baptism to this period.
In the East, the Epiphany, the great festival of the birth
of Christ and of His baptism, appeared to be naturally
indicated for the second birth, the regeneration, the baptism

century are witnesses to the custom in their respective
countries of blessing the baptismal waters on this day, and
of baptising the neophytes. The example of the East was
followed by several Western Churches, and it became
gradually the custom to put Christmas and several other

that the view of their having been distributed into four classes is based

on a wrong interpretation of the ancient texts.
