0 conflict as to use between the Irish missions from
Lindisfarne and the somewhat inactive mission in Κο1113,
which was always Roman in principle, even if its members
were not all Roman. The episcopal succession of Canter-
bury having come to an end, Pope Vitalian sent to
England (668), as its new archhishop, Theodore, a Greek
monk of Tarsus in Cilicia. It was to this man, as able and
energetic as he was conscientious‚ that the English Ohurch
owed its definitive foundation. He managed to 1000110110

evangelisation prospered in consequence. He doubtless made
concessions in liturgical matters, and condoned the customs
introduced by the Irish missionaries, for the oldest Anglo-
Saxon books by no means contain the Roman Liturgy in
an absolutely pure form; they abound, indeed, in Gallican
details.

Cum una sit fides, cur sunt ecclesiarum consuetudines tam diversae,
et altera consuetudo missarum est in Romana ecclesia atque altera in
Galliarum ecclesiis tenetur?

— Novit fraternitas tua Romanae ecclesiae consuetudinem in qua se

sive in qualibet ecclesia aliquid invenisti quod plus omnipotenti Deo
possit placere, sollicite eligas et in Anglorum ecclesia, quae adhuc in
fide nova est, institutione praecipua quae de multis ecclesiis colligere
potuisti infundas, Non enim pro locis res, sed pro rebus loca nobis
