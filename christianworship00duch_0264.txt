242 CHRISTrAN WORSHIP: irs omem AND EVOLUTION.

Of the Quadragaeima (Τεσσαρακοστὴ, Lent) no traces
are found before the fourth century.1 The fifth canon
of the Council of Nicaea (325) contains the earliest
mention of it. From this time forward it is frequently
referred to, but at first chiefly as a time of preparation
for baptism, or for the absolution of penitents, or as a
season of retreat and recollection for the faithful living
in the world. Among the duties of these sacred weeks
fasting naturally occupied an important place, but the
practice varied in different countries. In the “festal
letters ’' of St. Athanasius 2 we are able to follow the progress
of the observance of Lent in Egypt. St. Athanasius speaks,
in the beginning, of the time of Lent and of the weelc of

¹ Origen's homily on Luke Χ, which is sometimes cited as an earlier
witness, exists only in the revised Latin text of Rufinus, and cannot there-
fore be regarded as evidence of a custom contemporary with the great
doctor of Alexandria. What it says of the fast of forty days is manifestly
in contradiction with the sequence of ideas in this fragment.

² See especially those of the years 329, 330, 340, 341, 347. In the first
(329) it is merely dealt with as a preparation for the festival of Easter,
and that, too, in a general way without any mention of the Quadragesima:
the fast is indicated in the index as commencing on the Monday in
Holy Week. In 330 the Quadragesimal period is mentioned as lasting
sor six weeks, but the fast, strictly speaking, is always that of Holy Week.
It was well understood that fasting was among the number of necessary
exercises preparatory to the observance of Easter; it was not, however,
prescribed as of strict obligation, or as a custom accepted everywhere. The
Egyptians maintained, for the most part, only the fast of Holy Week. While
St. Athanasius was at Rome in 340 and the following years, he was the
subject of reproach in respect of this practice. He complains of this in a
note appended to his festal letter of 341. It was dated at Rome, and
addressed to his friend Serapion, Bishop of Thmuis, who was charged with
the super-vision of the Churches of Egypt in his absence. He exhorts him
in impressive terms to enjoin upon the Egyptians the observance of the
fast, saying that they make themselves the laughing-stock of the world.
From this time for-ward the index mentions regularly the fast of the
Forty Days and of Holy Week. Previously St. Athanasius spoke of them
as the time of Lent and the week of the fast. In the festal letter of
347 it is formally declared that he “who shall neglect the observance
of Lent shall not celebrate Easter‚'' or, in other words, shall be excom-

municated for a time.
