2. Preparation for Baptism.

The preparation for baptism, at Rome as elsewhere,
consisted of a series of instructions and exercises during
the season of Lent. The meetings for this purpose were
called serutinies; and in the seventh century amounted to
seven in number. No Roman collection of catechetical
instructions is now in existence which might be compared
with those of St. Oyril of Jerusalem, but the latter is
sufficient to give us an idea of the nature and form of the
teaching given preparatory to baptism.l

As the name suggests, the scrutinies were designed to
test the preparation of the candidates, and especially to
present them to the faithful, wh0, if the occasion arose,
could protest against the admission of such as might be
unworthy. Upon this matter the documents are necessarily
mute. They contain nothing beyond the prayers and the
rites. The latter had in view the gradual casting out
of the evil spirit by forcing him to relinquish his hold
over those who were about to pass into the kingdom of
Christ.

In the seventh century the scrutinies began in the
third week of Lent. At the Stational Mass on the Monday
an announcement2 was made from the ambo of the first of
these meetings—

Scrutinii diem, dilectissimi Fratres, quo electi nostri divinitus in-
struantur, imminere cognoscite. Ideoque sollicita devotione, succedente

¹ The sermons of St. Augustino addressed ad competentes (Nos. 56—59‚
112-116) may be regarded as representing the Latin custom, and even
the Roman, for Africa followed, both in baptismal and other rites‚ the
order prevailing at Rome.

² Gel.‚ i. 29. The Gelasian Saeramentary gives after this the rites
of the catechumenate such as have been just described. The Ordo also

assigns them to the first serutiny, but this may not have been their
original place.
