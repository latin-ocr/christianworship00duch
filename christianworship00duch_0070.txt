50 GHRISTIAN wonsmr: 1Ts ORIGIN ΑΜ) EVOLUTION.

On the day of the Sun (Sunday) all who live in towns or in the country
gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the
Writings of the prophets are read as long as time permits. Then when
the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs and exhorts to the
imitation of the good examples cited. Then all rise together, and prayers
are offered. At length, as we have already described, prayer being ended,
bread and wine and water are brought, and the president offers prayer and
thanksgivings to the best of his ability, and the people assent by saying
Amen .· and the distribution is made to each one of his share of the
elements which have been blessed, and to those who are not present it is
sent by the miuistry of the deacons.

Of the four elements borrowed from the current usage of
the synagogue-—namely‚ the lection, the chent, the homily,
and the prayer—the only one of which there is here no
express mention is the chanting of the Psalms. In another
passage of his A220l093s‚1 St. Justin, in explaining the
ceremonies of baptism, adds a description of the eucha-
ristie liturgy in terms similar to those just cited, except
that he here makes mention of the kiss of peace, which
the Christiane, he says, give to one another after the prayers‚
and before beginning the sacred meai, or Eucharist, properly
so called.

St. Justin confines himself to the description of the order
of service followed in the Christian assemblies 1 he gives no
text, or formulary of prayer or exhortation. His omissione
on this point, however, can be made good by the help of
very ancient ecclesiastical documents.

The epistle of St. Clement of Rome preserves for us a
passage evidently of a liturgical character. We cannot,
indeed, regard it as a reproduction of a sacred formulary,
but it is an excellent example of the style of solemn prayer
in which the ecclesiastical leaders of that time were accus-
tomed to express themselves at meetings for worship.

“May the sealed number of the elect in the whole world be preserved

¹ I. 65.
