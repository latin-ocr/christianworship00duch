Holy Spirit was merely the completion of the initiation.
While, however, baptism might be performed by the inferior
members of the Christian community, the imparting of
the Holy Spirit was reserved 130 the chief rulers, to the

method of procedure was by imposition of hands, there

person. The candidate had to prepare himself for it by
prayer, fastings, and holy vigils. It was usually administered
at Easter or during the fifty days following. Before enter-ing
the font, which had been previously blessed, the neophyte
solemnly renounced the devil, his pomps, and his angels.4
After the sacred washing, eonserred in the Name of the
F ather, the Son, and the Holy Ghost‚ he received an unction

not certain, is nevertheless quite a probable one.
