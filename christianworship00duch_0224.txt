7. The Dismissal of the Catecliurnens.

GERMAIN: Oateehumenum erqo diaconus icleo elamat
juxta anticum Ecclesiae ritum, ut tam juclaei quam haeretici
vel payani instructi, qui yrarides acl baptismum veniebant
et ante baptismum probabantur,1 starent in ecclesia et
audirent consilium Veteris et Novi Testamenti; postea
deprecarent pro illos levitae, diceret sacerdos collectam, post
precem exirent postea foris qui clioni non erant stare dum
inferebatur oblatio, et foras ante ostium auscultarent pro-
strat-i ad terram maynalia. Quae eura acl diaconum vel
acl ostiarium pertinebat, ut ille2 eos admoneret eccire, iste
provideret ne quis indignus retardaretur in templo, dicendo:
“Nolite clare Sanctum canibus, neque mittat-is maryaritas
ante poreosf'

By the second half of the sixth century the cate-
chumenate had become merely a reminiscence. It was
necessary then to explain the missa (dismissal) catechu-
menorum, of which the rite, however, continued to be
preserved.3 This ceremony took place after the prayer,
as in the Liturgy of Constantinople. In the Apostolic
Constitutione it is placed before the prayer. We cannot
gather precisely from the text of St. Germain whether it
was accompanied by special prayers. I am inclined to
believe that its text has in view the prayers which Ι
have just dealt with, but that at the beginning there
were special prayers, which disappeared with the dis-
appearance of the catechumens. Thus, at the end of the
sixth century, at least in the Church of Paris, nothing
more was said than some such formulary as Ne quis cate-
chumenus, catechumeni recedant, etc.
