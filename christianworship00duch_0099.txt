THE MAss IN THE EAsr. 79

which follows (27), entitled‚ “For the People‚'' deals in
detail with all the objects and classes of persons prayed
for by the Church in her solemn supplications—the well-
being of the faithful, the peace of the State, the tranquillity
of the Church‚ for the slaves, the poor, the aged, the
travellers, the sick, etc. The three last accompany the
imposition of hands on the catechumens (28), on the faithful
(29), and on the sick (30).

I do not believel that these twelve formularies represent
the official or ordinary ordo liturgicus of the Church of
Thmuis, but they are all of a nature applicable to a non-
liturgical service, or to a liturgical service before the ana-
phora, or prayer of sacrifice.

2. Later Liturqies.

Religious unity in Egypt was broken up after the con-
demnation of the Patriarch Dioscorus by the Oouncil of
Chalcedon. After a century of fruitless attempts to bring
the dissentients once more within the pale of orthodoxy, the
Imperial Government found itself obliged to acknowledge
the coexistence of two Ohurches within the country. One,
the orthod0X‚ supported by the Government and the
Byzantine official world, the other, the hereticaL upheld by
the mass of the indigenous population. This division did
not immediately make itself apparent in the sphere of
worship, both heretics and orthodox continuing to follow the
ancient use os Alexandria. But the official Church modified
this use little by little, under the influence of the Liturgy
of Constantinople, until a time came when the latter was
completely substituted for it.

¹ In this I differ from the Bishop of Salisbury‚ Dr. Wordsworth, who
has published the “Prayer-book” of Sarapion in English, with a learned
commentary—Bishop Sarapion's Prayer-book: S.P.O.K., London, 1899.
