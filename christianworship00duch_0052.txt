32 CHRISTIAN woasHIP: irs omem AND EVOLUTION.

Gaul, Spain, and Britain are countries of which the limits
are clearly defined by nature. In the fourth century the
difference in the degree of civilisation which possibly existed,

We must not, however, ignore the peculiar position
which Milan held, towards the end of the fourth century,

and at Thessalonica, and he it was who was commissioned
