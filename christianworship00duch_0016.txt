TRANSLATOR'S PREFAGE To THE
SEOOND EDITION.

ΤΗΕ text of the second English edition has been revised by
the Author, who has made some important additions. The
so-called Pereqrin-atio Silviae is now attributed to its real
authoress, a Spanish Religious (p. 490), and her description of
the services at Jerusalem, given in the Appendix, has been
revised from the latest edition of the Arezzo MS„ that of
Mons. Paul Geyer. In response to several requests, an
English translation of this excerpt has been added on p.
547, et seq. For this Ι am mainly indebted to my brother,
the Rev. George Herbert‚ who had the advantage of many
criticisms and suggestions from so eminent a scholar as the
late Canon Chas. Evans, formerly Headmaster of King
Edward's School, Birmingham.

Mgr. Duchesne has also inserted in the Appendix, the
text of the Emaltet of Bari, which will be found on p. 543.

In order not to disturb the pagination of the previous
edition, which is uniform with that of the French, the new
matter introduced into the text has, when it occupies one
or more pageS, been distinguished by a letter in addition to

the number.

All Saints’Day, 1904.

P.S.——Delete the sentence in Note 2, p. 256, beginning, “ I regret that
Ι have been prevented,⁷' etc„ as Mgr. Duchesne subsequently saw, and
has printed in this edition, the Exultets referred to.
