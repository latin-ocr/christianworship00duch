and indubitably of the second century, like Pope Tele-
sphorus and St. Justin Martyr—were not inscribed in the
ecclesiastical calendars of the time of Constantine. The
anniversaries inserted in these calendars refer to martyrs
cf the third century at the earliest. The Christian epitaphs
at Rome, moreover, belonging to a date earlier than the
third century, contain no indication of the day of the
death of the deceased, whether they were martyrs or not.
The case would have been different if, as early as this, the
funeral anniversary had become the subject of a religious
commemoration‚ and, as far as the martyrs were concerned,
of an ecclesiastica] solemnisation. From the beginning of
the third century, on the other hand, the celebration of the
anniversary became a matter of universal observance.

The anniversaries of martyrs were, naturally, local festi-
vals. Each Church honoured its own saints. Sometimes,
owing, it may be, to the lack of special festivals for each
martyr, or in the way of addition to these festivals, a general
commemoration of all the martyrs of a locality was celebrated.

The practice soon arose of one Church adopting the com-
memorations of another, and thus the festivals of the most
distinguished saints were celebrated elsewhere, as well as in
their own country. Some even attained an almost oecumenical
veneration, such as St. Xystus [Sixtus] and St. Laurence of
Rome, and St. prrian of Carthage, etc. The translation
of relies, real or representative, gave, from the fourth century
onwards, a great impulse to this form of veneration, and to
the festivals associated with it.

There soon came to be associated with the martyrs the
holy confessors, that is, the ascetae, using the term in its
fourth-century significance, such as St. Martin, St. Anthony,
St. Simeon StyliteS, etc.

Among the local festivals there must also be mentioned
the anniversaries of the dedications of churches, and of the
ordination (natale) and burial (depositio) of bishops.
