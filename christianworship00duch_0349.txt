CEREMONIES or CHRISTIAN INITIATION. 325

He is then plunged three times in the consecrated water.
This was not the case in Spain, where single immersion was
considered as a protest against Arianism.l

The baptismal formularies which are given in the
Gallicam books all have something additional 'to the text
as used at Rome. With all their vafiations, they agree in
introducing the words ut habeas vitam aeternam?

As he left the water the neophyte was led to the
bishop, who made the sign of the cross on his head with
fragrant oil,3 reciting meanwhile the formulary—

Deus omnipotens, qui te regeneravit ex aqua et Spiritu sancto con-
cessitque tibi peccata tua, ipse te ungat in vitam aeternam.4

tract. 2) gives the following formulary: “ Credis in Deum Patrem omni-
potentem? Credis et in Jesum Christum, Filium ejus, qui conceptus est
de Spiritu sancto et natus est ex Maria Virgine? Credis et in Spiritum
sanctum?’' Further on he adds: ‘⁶ Credis in sanctam Ecclesiam et
remissionem peccatorum P '’

meaning than that attached to it.

² Miss. Gom: “Baptizo te, 111 nomine P. et F. et Sp. s. in remissionem

sanctis.’'

³ The Bobbio Sacramentary specifies: Suffundis chrisma in fronte
eus.
J ⁴ This formulary is given in the De Sacrame71tz‘s5 it is found with some
slight variations in the Missale Gallicanum and in the Bobbio Sacramentary,
It is almost identical with the Roman formulary of the chrismatio, and
strongly resembles that given by the anonymous Arian (Z. c.): Deus et
pater domiui nostri Jesu Christi qui te reyeneravit ex aqua ipse te linet
(read: linat) Spiritu Sancto, etc. The Missale Gothicum here contains a
formulary which appears to be corrupt and to have been amalgamated with
that of the giving of the white garment: “Perungo te chrisma sanctitatis,
tunicam immortalitatis, quam D. N. J esus Christus traditam a Patre primus
