certain times were also singled out, either in accordance
with Holy Scripture, or J ewish tradition, or even in
agreement with the customs of ordinary and civil life.
It was natural to take advantage of the moment when
the family met together for the midday meal, and later
on, when they again separated, to continue the avocations
of their daily lise. Two regular times of prayer were thus
obtained—two hours, observed privately, but habitually.
Others, calling to mind that Daniel prayed three times a
day, concluded that it would be profitable to follow his
example. The three hours were indicated in the Acts
of the Apostles, where we see the disciples gathered
together for prayer at the hour of tierce, when the Holy
Spirit came upon them on the Day of Pentecost; St.
Peter goes up to the roos of the house to pray, at the
110111 of sext, before partaking of his meal3 and finally,
the apostles Peter and John enter the temple for prayer
at the hour of none. These hours, moreover‚ constituted
the principal divisione of the day3 they were observed
for business, and were marked by the call of the city
bell-23.l

It is from Tertullian that we learn the observance of
these three “ hours'' of the day, and it is he who thus ex-
plains their origin. Clement of Alexandria was also aware²
of this division of the Christian day. In his Cathemerinon
Prudentius appears to take his inspiration from a some-
what different custom, that which Ι first described, but
with the hours of matins and vespers doubled. There is
a hymn for the hour when the cock crows, Ales diei
nuntius, another for the dawn‚ Nox et tenebrae et nubila ;
others are written for before and after the midday meal,
O crucifer bone, lueis sator, Pastis visceribus ciboque sampt0;
