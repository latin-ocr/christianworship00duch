THE MAss IN THE EAsr. 55

great metropolitan Churches widened the circle of their
missione, they extended also the area of their special uses,
for it is altogether natural that the use of the Mother
Ghurch should become a law to the daughter Churches.
It was in this manner that the liturgical provinces, if we may
use the expression, became identified with the ecclesiastical
provinces.l

We may refer the liturgies with which we are acquainted
to four principal types—the Syrian, the Alexandrian, the
Roman, and the Gallican. It might not be impossible,
moreover‚ to trace back the Gallican to the Syrian type,
and to infer that the use of Alexandria was derived, as
far as a certain portion is concerned, from that of Rome.
The four different forms would thus be reduced to two, a
division which is analogous to that which obtains to—day,
when the uses of Rome and Constantinople have almost
absorbed the rest.

But the documents do not carry us so far back. We are
certain that in the fourth century there were four types at
the very least, for the Syrian type had already given origin
to some very marked sub-types.

¹ On the Eastem liturgies, the work of capital importance is now
Lituryies Easte'rn cond Western, by F. E. Brightman, vol. i., Oxford, 1896.
Ι shall have to make constant reference to it. I shall rarely have occasion
to cite the book of the same title by C. E. Hammond, published in 1878,
for Brightmau’s book is a second edition of this, considerably improved

and enlarged.
