(responds)‚ and they were thus called because the congregation
made, in fact, a response to them by repeating the final clause.

The Roman custom permitted the use of two kinds of
melodies for this class of sacred chants. One of these was
designated by a term which has no reference to its musical
character. This was what was called the gradual, which
was sung at the ambo, or mendas, and took from this fact
its name of Psalmus madualis. The other was the Psalmus
tractus, or tract. At the time to which the most ancient
documents dealing with these details go back, the Psalmus
tractus was, like the gradual, sung at the ambo, and not in
the choir. Its name of tractus can thus be derived only
from some peculiarity 111 1133 execution. Amalarius tells us,
in fact, that the tract differed from the Psalmus responsorius
in that the choir did not respond to it as they did to the
latter.1

The custom of singing the Alleluia is very ancient in
the Church‚ but the adaptation of this chant to the liturgical
service did not take place until late, and then with con-
siderable diversity in its use. At Rome it was joined to
the last verse of the gradual psalm. In the East and
in the countries of the Gallican rite, it was sung still
later in the service, that is, after the GospeL or at the
procession of the oblation.

Towards the end of the fourth century there was intro-
duced side by side with the psalmus responsorius another
kind of psalmody‚ the antiphon, which consisted of a psalm
chanted by two choirs alternately. It was at Α111310011,2 111
the time of Bishop Leontius (344-357)‚ that this custom
was introduced. Under the guidance of two ascetics,
