350 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

the preparation of candidates for baptism, and they became
obsolete with the disappearance of the catechumenate. The
inscriptions in which they are mentioned do not any-
where connect them with the titulary ohurches or regions
of Rome, although they ought to have been grouped, like
the other clericS, according to the latter. From the begin-
ning of the sixth century we hear but little of them31 if
’ there continued to be still exorcists at Rome, they must
have been among the minor clerics of the schola cantorum.

ξ 2.—LAT1N CEREMONIES or ORDINATION.

The authorities which have come down to us on the
rites of ordination in the Latin Church are as follows :—

1. The Statura Ecclesiae Antiqua, a collection of dis—
ciplinary and liturgioal canons drawn up in Gaul, in the
province of Aries, about the beginning of the sixth 06111311137.2
We find in them the principal ceremonies of ordination
sor all the orders. It is evident from these ceremonies
that the use was Gallican. It is probably the only text
in which that use is preserved free from any admixture,

for the Gallican liturgical books do not contain the cere-
monies of ordination.

2. The Roman Saerasmemaries.—We must confine our

it was a month. The second pseudo-Silvestrian Council requires for it ten
years. As to the actual discipline, see the decretals cited above, p. 346,
note 3. The Oonstitutum, which mentions eighty lectors and forty—five
acolytes, enumerates only twenty-two exorcists at Rome.

¹ The inscriptions, moreover‚ mention 611 exoroist, who died in 511, at
Eclana; and another at Coruo, in 526 (Gorp. lusor. Lat„ vol. ix„ No. 1381;
vol. V„ No. 6428).

² Maasen, Quellen, vol, i. p. 382; Malnory, S. Uesuuii& p. 50. This
collection was inserted, under the title Concilium Carthaginiense quartum,
in the Spanish body of canons (Hispana), from whence it passed into that of
the pseudo-Isidore. It is still quoted by many under the latter title, and,
what is more serious, pronounced as 611 authority for African ecclesiastical
usages in the fourth century.
