Books 01 THE LATIN RITE. 127

It was evidently the same text as that used by Cardinal
Tommasi, and it is, in fact, under the name of Gelasian
Sacramenta-ry that it is quoted in a compilation of the tenth
century published by Dom Gerbert. The author of this
compilation desired to bring together in one volume the
three texts—Gelasian‚ Gregorian, and Ambrosian. For the
first of these he simply copied MS. 348 of St. Gall, which
still bears traces of this work of transcription.1 Walafrid
Strabo, who wrote in the neighbourhood of St. Gall, cannot
have meant anything else by the word Gelasian. For the
matter of that, only two types of Roman Sacramentaries
were known in France, namely‚ that of Adrian, bearing
the name of St. Gregory, and when any other type is
mentioned, there can be no doubt as to its meaning the
Gelasian. This remark is applicable to the designations
used in the catalogue of St. Riquier. As to John the
Deacon‚ who lived at Rome, we may imagine that in
his case the term Oodeoe Gelasimus might be applied to
some other form of the Roman Sacramentary. But this
supposition must be set aside, since John the Deacon
speaks of the Sacramentary anterior to St. Gregory in
terms which are exactly applicable to the text which
we have now under consideration. It is, indeed, much
longer than that of the Gregorian Sacramentary (multa
subtralwns); the formularies common to both are almost
always the same (pauca convertens); it is divided into
several books, whereas the Gregorian Sacramentary com-
prises only one (iot unius libri volumine coartaviffl

The question now arises, why the name Gelasian was
applied to this Liber sacramentorum? The title in the
manuscript of the Vatican and of St. Gall (that of Rheinau
