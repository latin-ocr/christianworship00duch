296 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

The insufflation‚ with a formulary of exorcism3

The signing with the cross on the forehead ;

The administering of salt. Ἴ

The convert presents himself before the priest, who,
after blowing in his face,1 marks him on the forehead
with the sign of the cross, saying, In nomine Patris et
Filii et Spiritus sancti. This ceremony is followed by a
prayer, which the priest recites, holding his hand extended
over the candidate : ²

Omnipotens, sempiterne, Deus, Pater domini nostri Jesus Christi,
respicere dignare super hunc famulum tuum quem ad rudimenta fidei
vocare dignatus es. Omnem caecitatem cordis ab eo expelle; disrumpe
omnes laqueos Satanae quibus fuerat conligatus Aperi ei, Domine,
januam pietatis tuae, et signo sapientiae tuae imbutus omnium cupidita-
tum foetoribus careat, et suavi odore praeceptorum tuorum laetus tibi in
Ecclesia deserviat, et proficiat de die in diem, ut idoneus efficiatur
accedere ad gratiam baptismi tuj, percepta medicina.

Then follows the administering of the salt,3 which had
been previously exorcised :—

¹ This ceremony is not given in the Ordo or in the Sacramentaries‚
but it is attested by John, the Roman deacon, in his letter to Senarius,
an official of the time of Theodoric (Migne‚ Pat. Lat„ vol. lix. p. 402).
He says even that it was followed by an exorcism, ut exeat et recedat
(diabolus). These words are also found in the formularies for exorcism
which were prescribed according to the custom of the seventh century
for the scrutiny at Lent.

² Ι give the text of the Gelasian Sacramentary, i. 30, using the
singular for the plural number. The two other formularies which follow
this prayer seem to be variants. This prayer is also found in the Gregorian
Sacramentary, p. 60 (Muratori), but it is incomplete towards the end.
Beside the ritual given in i. 30-32‚ the Gelasian Sacramentary furnishes
another, i. 71, which has supplied much of the material of the ritual
of the present day. Ι think, however, that this second ritual is Gallicam,
with the exception of the administering of the salt, which is decidedly
Roman, but which is accompanied in this case by no formulary. The
formularies i. 71, or something like them, are found in the Missale
Gothicum and in the Gallican Sacramentary.

³ The administering of salt is mentioned by John the Deaoon:
