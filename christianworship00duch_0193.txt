THE ROMAN MAss. 171

the homily appears to have fallen into disuse at Rome
at a somewhat early period. St. Gregory, and St. Leo
before him, were the only early Popes who left homilies
behind them, or, indeed, seem, as far as we know, to
have preached them. The homilies of St. Leo are, more—
over, short, and restricted to certain solemn festivals.
Roman priests had no authority to preach‚ and the Popes
looked askance at the permission to do so granted to their
clergy by other bishops.l Sozomen, who wrote about the
time of Pope Xystus HL, tells us that no one preached

at Rome.2

There is no trace to be found in the liturgical books
of the eighth century of the dismissal of catechumens and
penitents. This is owing to the fact that they were
drawn up at a time when discipline in regard to
catechumens and penitents had been largely modified.
There were no longer any adult catechumens, and public
penitents were usually shut up in monasteries. The
ancient formularies of the missa catechumenorum and of the
missa paenitentiam were preserved, notwithstanding, and
occur respectively in the order of baptism already re-
ferred to, and in one of St. Gregory⁷s dialogues. On
the day of the “Opening of the Ears'' the deacon dis-
missed the candidates for baptism with the words,
Catechumeni recedant! St quis catechumenus est rrecedat!
Omnes catechumeni eaeant foras! St. Gregory 3 relates
that two nuns‚ who had been excommunicated by St.
Benefflct, were buried in a certain church, and that
whenever the deacon cried out, at each Mass celebrated
there, the words, Sz‘ quis non communicat, det locum ! their
foster mother used to see them arise from their graves
