196 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: 1Ts omem AND EVOLUTION.

Benedicite on certain days, and provides for a respond,
called the stemnius, after the Prophetis Lection, and a
verse accompanied by the Alleluia after the Apostolic
Lection. The following is the introduction to the Bene-

dicite in the Mozarabic rite ¹ :—

Daniel Propheta. Tunc ilh‘ tres quasi ex uno ore hymnum cane-
bant et benedicebant Dominum de fornace, dicentes: Benedictus es

Domine, etc.

This is almost the actual text of Daniel iii. 51. The
respond for the Nativity in the Mozarabio Missal is arranged
as follows :—

Dominus dixit ad me: Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te.—V. Pete
a me et dabo tibi gentes haereditatem tuam et possessionem tuam terminos

terrae—HJ. Ego hodie genui te.

According to St. Germain, this respond was sung by
boys (parvuli). Gregory of Tours assigns the singing of
it to a deacon. The use at Tours2 may possibly have
differed from that of Paris on this point. The Roman
use in this respect underwent an important change at

the end of the sixth century.³
