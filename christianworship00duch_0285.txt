THE OHRISTIAN FEsrrvALs. 263

a celebration of the Passion of our Lord on that day, but
also a festival of His Resurrection on the 27th of the same
month‚ without interfering, however, with the movable feasts
of Good Friday and Easter Sunday.1

These festival observances imply an inveterate tradition.
We are not, on this account, to assume that this tradition
had an historical basis. The Passion certainly did not occur
on a 25th of March.2 This date must have been arbitrarily
chosen, or rather suggested, from its coincidence with the
(official) spring equinox, The death of Christ was thus
made to sallon the same day as that on which, according to
an universal belief, the world had been created.

This date having once been determined, and determined,
too, from astronomica] and symbolical considerations, it was

not unnatural that it should be used to establish another
coincidence. Christ must have lived upon earth, it was

thought, for only a complete number of years. Fractions
are imperfectioris which do not fall in with the demands of
a symbolical system of numbers, and hence they must be
got rid of as completely as possible. The Incarnation must,
therefore, like the Passion, have taken place on the 25th of
March, and as the Incarnation was reckoned from the first
moment of the conception of Mary, the birth of Christ must
have taken place on the 25th of December.

This explanation would be the more readily received is

Hist. Fr„ X. 31; Hieronymian Martyrology, 25th and 27th of March. Of.
Martin de Eraga, De Pascha 1 (Migne, Pat. Lat„ vol. xxxii. p. 50): “A
plerisque Gallicanis episcopis usque ante non multum teinpus custoditum est
ut semper viii. kal. april. diem Paschae (inexact) celebrarent, in quo facta
Christi resurrectio traditur.’' There is some confusion here. Passio should
be read for resurrectio, unless Martin meant to write vi. kal. in place of
viii. kal.

² In the years 29 and 35 the 25th of March fell on a Friday, but this
Friday could not have been either the day of the Jewish Passover, or the
day following it. The age of the moon is opposed to this. In the interval
between tho years 29 and 35, the 25th of March does not occur on a Friday.
