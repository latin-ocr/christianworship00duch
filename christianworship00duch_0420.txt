and resembling those prescribed by the Theodosian Gode for
certain classes of functionarieS. The Roman Church‚ for one
reason or another, refused to accept them, or rather confined
itseli' to the adoption of the papal pallium, which soon acquired
a distinctly special significance. Elsewhere, this vestment
was adopted for the three superior orders of the hiemrchy,
introducing slight differences according to the ecclesiastical
rank to which the wearer belonged. The deacon wore it
over one shoulder‚ the priest and bishop around the neck3
the deacon over the tunicle, which was his upper garment,
the priest under the planeta, the bishop above it.1

The pallium, with the exception of the crosses which
ornamented its extremities, was always white in colour,
as was also the stole of the deacon and that of the priest
or bishop. The pallium has universally and from all time
been made of wool. In the East the diaconal stole was of
linen, but I am unable to say of what material either it or
that of the priest was composed in the countries of the West.*

¹ We have, however, very little information as to this method of
differentiating priest and bishop. The Canon of the third Council
of Eraga (see supra, p. 391), decreeing that priests should cross the
orarium over the breast, presupposes thereby that it was worn under the
planeta. The council does not say that this method of wearing it was to
be peculiar to priests only, and that bishops should follow some other
fashion. The term sacerdotes, which it employs‚ may include bishops as
well as priests. Beyond this, we can glean no information from the
ancient ecclesiastica] literature of Spain. In Gaul, St. Germain of Paris
speaks of the episcopal pallium after having described the chasuble, which
might lead us 10 believe that the pallium was worn above it. Ι have
already mentioned that Bishop Ecclesius of Ravenna is represented with
the stole, or orarium, hanging down in front, under the planeta, while at
the same time he wears the pallium over it, and that this custom was
adopted in France in the Carlovingian period. The Greek bishops also
wear simultaneously the epitrachelion and the omophorion. This accumu-
lation of insignia was forbidden in Spain in the seventh century (Cone.
Tol„ iv. 0. 39), and we note that the Pope abstained from wearing both vest-
ments till about the twelfth century, having previously used the pallium
only, without the stole.
