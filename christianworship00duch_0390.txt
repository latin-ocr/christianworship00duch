them seriatim, furnishing at the same time the formularies

archdeacon as to his conduct in the “House of God‚'’
and 18 then presented by him to the bishop, who, taking
the keys of the church from the altar, hands them to the
candidate, saying 1—-

Then, in place of the blessing‚ preceded, according to
the Gallican custom‚ by an invitatory or preface, the
following prayer 18 used :—

Deum Patrem omnipotentem suppliciter deprecemur ut hunc famulum
suum nomine Illum benedicere dignetur, quem in officium ostiarii eligere
dignatus est, ut sit 81 fidelissima cura in diebus ac noctibus ad distinctionem
horarum certarum ad invocandum nomen Domini.

far as ordinations are 80118811181-1, a mixture of the two ancient rituals, the
Roman and the Gallican.

² This formulary, as well as the analogous formulary used for the
ordination of lectors (Accipe et esto) and that for exorcists (Accipe et
commenda), are to be found in the Statata, which fact implies that they
were in use, at Arles at least, as early as the end of the fifth century.
