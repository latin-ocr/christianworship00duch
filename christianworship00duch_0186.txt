The Kyrie eleison may be considered as a remnant of
the Litany form of prayer, or dialogus between one of the
sacred ministers and the whole congregation. This form
of prayer occupies, as we have seen, a prominent place in
the Greek liturgies. The Liturgy of Constantinople, for
instance, contains a litany to be said at the beginning of the
Mass, before the entry of the celebrants. It would appear
also that at Rome, in early times, it formed the initial
portion of the Liturgy. It was customary in the eighth
century on the Litany days, that is, the days on which
the people went in general procession to the church of the
station, to sing neither Kyrie nor Gloria. The service
at the church began directly with the Pax vobis and the
first prayer. The Kyrz'e, in like manner, was omitted on
the days appointed for ordinations, because on such occa—
sions the Litany was sung after the gradual. Even at
the present time the Kyrie eleison in the Mass for Easter
Eve is nothing more than the conclusion of the Litany
with which that Mass commenced.1 St. Gregory² is
the authority for the statement that in his time the words
Kyrie eleison and Christe eleison were accompanied, except
in the daily Masses, by other formularies. These formu-
laries were, doubtless‚ a litany more or less elaborated.

The Litany of the Saints at present in use has preserved
this ancient form of dialogue-prayer as it was accustomed
to be said in the Roman Church. It has, doubtless, been

¹ This correlation of the Kyric and Litany is still clearly manifest in

the Ordines of the twelfth century.

tantummodo Kyrie eleison et Christe eleison dicimus, ut in his deprecationis
vocibus paulo diutius occupemur.’'
