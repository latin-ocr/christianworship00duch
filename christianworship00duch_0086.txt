interval when it was restored under the Emperor Philippicus
(711-713). It held its ground, however, at the convent of
John Maron, in the Lebanon, and within the radius of
influence of this monastery. Hence the origin of the
religious group of the Maronites, who, after having main-
tained their dogmatic isolation for five hundred years, entered,
in 1182, into communion with the Roman Church—in a
somewhat precarious fashion, it is true, for even up to the
end of the sixteenth century the union was subject to con-
siderable fluctuations. The Maronites were governed from
their monastery, in which a certain number of bishops resided.
After many efforts, success at length attended the attempt to
substitute for this primitive organisation a sort of eccle-
siastica] province, with dioceses and fixed episcopal seats.
The bishops recognised a patriarch as their head, who took
his title from Antioch. Syriae is 13116 liturgical language
of the Maronites, as it is of the Jacobites, both Uniats
and non-Uniats.1

Alongside these 1161101161 patriarchs‚ whose origin goes
back 10 1116 heretica] schism, the official and orthodox
Patriarch of Antioch maintained his existence, although
numerous secessions had much enfeebled 1118 position.
His peculiar liturgy was gradually supplanted by that
of Constantinople, the only one which is now in use in
the Greek Churches of the Patriarchate of Antioch. A

¹ The Maronite patriarchate is therefore quite a modern institution. Its
titular patriarche are in no respect the successors of the ancient Patriarchs

of Antioch. This is not the case, however, with regard to the Syrian
patriarchs, the Melchite patriarch, and the Greek non-Uniat patriarch.
These two last represent—with the difference of communion—the succession
of the Greek orthodox patriarchs of Antioch; the Syrian patriarchs, with
the same difference, are the inheritors of the Jacobite patriarchal 866
founded in the sixth century. Strictly speaking, there ought not to be
in Syria another Catholic patriarch than the Melchite. The existence of
the other two 18 due to the respect with which the holy see considers it
right to regard distinctions introduced centuries age, whatever their
legitimacy may have been at their beginning.
