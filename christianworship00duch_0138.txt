118 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: 1Ts omem AND EVOLurroN.

as are said aloud. This practice may be very ancient. It was
necessarily introduced as soon as the Christian assemblies
became very large, and thus rendered it difficult for the
officiat'mg minister or reader to make himself heard. The
flections of the voice served for a scansion of the text,
and thus gave more relies to the intonation. But the
slight modulations resulting from this were more akin to
accentuated reading than to chanting properly so called.

It was for the same reason—namely, the difficulty of
maintaining a high intonation in a large building—that
the custom must have arisen of pronouncing in a low
voice certain formularies which were evidently intended
in the first instance to be heard by everybody. There
are two of such in the Roman Mass, viz, the prayer
called Secreta before the pmface, and the Canon from the
Sanctus onwards. According to the Eastern usage, many
other formularies of prayer are said in a low voice by
the officiating minister. But in every country these
formularies end in what the Greeks call an ecphonesis
(ἐκφώνησις), that is, in a raised inflection of the voice at
the end, so that the congregation may respond with Amen.
