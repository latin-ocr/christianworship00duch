EOCLESIASTICAL AREAS. 33

to provide Sirmium with a bishop at a critical moment
of its history. At Aquileia he presided over a council
at which the last difficulties connected with the Arian
crisis in the Lower Danubian provinces were disposed of.
It is, however, particularly in Gaul and Spain that the
ecclesiastical authority of Milan seems to have been
accepted as a natural and superior tribunal.

About the year 380 we find the Priscillianists of Spain
bringing their cause both before Pope Damasus and
Bishop Ambrose. Long after the bloody executions 01
Treves, at a time when the position of the dissentients
in Spain was in question again, both sides approached the
Bishop of Milan. The Galician prelates, who had remained
faithful 10 1116 traditions of Priscillian, had been summoned
by their colleagues assembled in Council at Toledo 10
appear before them. They refused 10 acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the latter, but 1116 foremost among the
dissentients, Symposius, the aged Bishop of Astorga, and his
son Dictinius, repaired 10 Μ11611. Α111101066 imposed very
hard conditions upon them, which, nevertheless, they pro-
mised 10 fulfil. Pope Siricius acted with him in this
matter, and advised the same solution 01 1116 difficulty. But
this decision did not put an end 10 the conflict. In the year
400, after the death of both Siricius and Ambrose, a fresh
council assembled at Toledo, and was successful this time
in securing the attendance 01 the Galician prelates. Several
difficulties were then settled, but on some points the council,
mistrusting its own authority, or faih'ng to come to an
agreement, made a formal appeal both 10 the new Pope
Anastasius, and to Simplicianus, the successor 01 St. Ambrose.

Not only in Spain, but also in Gaul, Priscillianism had
sown dissensions amongst the bishops. Some 01 111666
accepted, while others refused, communion with Felix,
Bishop of Treves, who had been ordained with the 0011-
