386 CHRIs'rIAN WORSHIP: rrs omem AND EVOLUTION.

Elijah, passed on to his successor Elisha.1 The pallium
thus became the natural sign 01 0 superior jurisdiction,
that is, of a species 01 participation in the Pasce oves meas.
As early as the sixth century the Bishops of Arles, and
in the following century those 01 Canterbury, wore it as
a mark of the special powers which they had received from
Rome.

On the conclusion of the alliance between the Pope and
the Carlovingian princes, when the Frankish Ohurch found
itself more closely related to Rome, the metropolitans accepted
the Roman palliam with the symbolism attached to it.

This conception 01 1110 pallium as a mantle was
suggested rather by the word itself than by the thing
denoted. The article designated by this term was not in
1110 form 01 0 3011110111, but 01 0 scarf. In the last analysis
this scarf was, no doubt, a relic 01 the short mantle which
had been brought 11110 105111011 111 1110 Roman Empire by the
Greeks. But the discolora pallia of the Theodosian Oode
were evidently scarves, and scarves of office, which were
worn over the paenula, as the pontifical pallium was worn
over the planeta. The Theodosian Oode mentions this sign
of office only in connection with functionaries 01 0 00111-
paratively humble rank, but the monuments represent it
on the shoulders 01 001151115, 0 1001 which gives ground for
belief that the Imperial Government conferred, in reality,
a very great mark 01 honour on the ecclesiastical dignitaries
upon whom they bestowed it.

A glance at a consular diptych* will illustrate what
I mean. The consul is there represented in the most
solemn act of 1115 inauguration, viz. 01 1110 moment
when he gives the signal to start the 1101505 111 1110 arena.

¹ As early as the sixth century a similar meaning was attached to the
pallium of Alexandria (Liberatus, Brea, 20).
