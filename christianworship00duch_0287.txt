THE GHRISTIAN FEsr1VALs. 265

for the birth of Christ was fixed from the assumed starting-
point of His Passion. Among all the solutions proposed
this seems to me the most satisfactory, but I would not
venture to say, in regard to the 25th of December, that the
coincidence of the Sol novus exercised no direct or indirect
influence on the ecclesiastical decisions arrived at in regard
to the matter.

The festival of Christmas is at the present day1 cha-
racterised in the Roman use by the celebration of three
Masses 3 one at cockcrow, w. before daylight (ad gyani
cantum), another at dawn, and the third in the morning.
This custom was in existence as early as the end of the
sixth century, and St. Gregory mentions it in one of his
homilies.2 It arose as follows. At the beginning of the
fifth century there was only one Mass-that of the
morning—and it was celebrated at St. Peter’s. Pope Celes-
tine received, on the morning of Christmas Day, 431, the
imperial letters which informed him of the result of the
Council of Ephesus, and he caused them to be read “at
the assembly of all the Christian people, at St. Peter's.'' 3
Oelestine's successor, Xystus [Sixtus] HI.,rebuilt the Liberian
Basilica on the Esquiline, and dedicated it to St. Mary. It
is only from that time forward that we hear of a Station or
nocturnal Mass on Christmas Day, and it has always been
celebrated in that church. Here, I believe, we have an imita-
tion of the use at Jerusalem, which permitted a night Station
at Bethlehem and a day Mass in Jerusalem itself. The Basilica
of Santa Maria Maggiore was, as it were, the Roman equiva-
lent of Bethlehem, and later on a Praesepe [manger or creelteL

¹ Before the sixth century it was not the custom at Rome to sing the
Gloria in excelsis except at the Feast of Christmas, and then only at the
nocturnal Mass (see infra). It is to Pope Symmachus (498-514) that we
owe its'use on Sundays and festivals (cf. supra, p. 166).
