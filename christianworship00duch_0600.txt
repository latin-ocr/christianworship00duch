574 APPENDIX.

2. Preparation for Raptim.-Oatechisinya

This also Ι must write, Reverend Sisters, lest you should
think that these things are done without good reason. The
custom here is that they who come to Baptism at this season
fast for forty days, but first they are exorcised by the Olergy
earlyjn the day, as soon as the morning Dismissal has been made
in the Anastasis. Immediately afterwards the chair is placed
for the Bishop at the Martyrium in the great church, and all
who are to be baptised sit around, near the Bishop, both men
and women, their fathers and mothers standing there also.
Besides these, all the people who wish to hear come in and sit
down—the faithful however only, for no catechumen enters
there when the Bishop teaches the others the law. Beginning
from Genesis he goes through all the Soriptures during those
forty days, explaining them, first literally, and then unfolding
them spiritually. They are also taught about the Resurrection,

and likewise all things concerning the Faith during those days.
And this is called the Catechising.

ὦ. “Traditio'' of the Oreed.

Then when five weeks are completed from the time when their
teaching began, the (Competents) then are taught the Creed.1
And as he explained the meaning of all the Scriptures, so does
he explain the meaning of the Creed 3 each article first literally
and then spiritually. By this means 311 the faithful in these
parts follow the Scriptures when they are read in church,
inasmuch as they are all taught during those forty days from
the first to the third hour, for the Gateohising lasts for three
hours. And God knows, Reverend Sisters, that the voices of the
faithful who come in to hear the Catechising are louder (in
approval) of the things spoken and explained by the Bishop than
they are when he sits and preaohes in church. Then, after the
Dismissal of the Catechising is made, it being already the third
hour, the Bishop is at once escorted with hymns to the Anastasis.
