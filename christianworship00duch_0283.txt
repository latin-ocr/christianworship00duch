THE CHRISTIAN FEsTIVALs. 261

What were the influences‚ we may ask, which led to the
adoption of these dates? Several answers have been pro-

posed, which I will here enumerate.
First‚ the Saczornalia of the Roman Calendar were con-

sidered to have been a determining motive. An endeavour
was made, it was thought, to turn away the faithful from
the observation of this popular festival by directing their
piety to the remembrance of Christ. This motive must be
discarded, for there is no coincidence between the two
festivals. The Saturnalia began on the 17111 of December,
and were not prolonged beyond the 23rd.

A better explanation is that based on the festival of the
Natalis Invidi, which appears in the Pagan Calendar of
the Philocalian collection under the 25111 of December. The
Invictus is the Sun, whose birth coincides with the winter
solstice‚ that is, with the 25111 of December, according 10 1116
Roman Calendar. The worship of Mithras, or, speaking
more generally, of the Sun, was widespread and popular in
the third and fourth centuries. One is inclined to believe
that the Roman Ohurch made choice of the 25th of
December in order to enter into rivalry with Mithraism.1
This reason, however, leaves unexplained the choice of the
6111 of January. The following solution has the advantage
of explaining both festivals at the same time.

The date of the birth of Christ was fixed by taking as
a starting-point that which was believed to be the day
of His death.

The latter date cannot be determined with historical
accuracy. The information given in the Gospels and fur-
nished by tradition is insufficient to enable us to come to a
definite solution of the question. Attempts were made,
however, at an early date to solve the problem. Olement of
Alexandria2 mentions certain private calculations which
