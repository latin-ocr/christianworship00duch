prayer which we call a litany, elaborated‚ according to
circumstances, into a long series of invocations addressed
to Grod and to angels and saints.

The day set apart for this purpose at Rome was the
25th of April, a traditional date, being that on which the
ancient Romans celebrated the festival of the Robigalia.
The principal ceremony of the latter was a procession,
which, setting out from the Flaminian Gate, made its
way towards the Milvian Bridge, and arrived at length at
a suburban sanctuary some distance off, that is, at the
fifth milestone on the Claudian Way.l The Christian
procession which replaced it followed the same route as
far as the Milvian Bridge. It set out from the Church
of St. Laurence in Lucina, the nearest to the Flaminiar]
Gate, held a station at St. Valentine outside the walls,
and afterwards at the Milvian Bridge. From thence, instead
of proceeding along the Glaudian Way, it turned to the
left towards the Vatican, stopped at a cross‚ of which the
site is not given, and again in the paradise or atrium of
St. Peter, and finally in the basilica itself, where the
station was held.2

The most ancient authority for this ceremony is a
