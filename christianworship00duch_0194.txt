and go out of the holy place. The manner in which St.
Gregory explains Cumque . . . EX MORE diaconus clamaret,
seems to indicate that this form of dismissal, or one equiva-
lent to it, was still in use in his time, that is, at the end
of the sixth century.

5. The Prayer of the Faithful.

After the Mass of the catechumens had been said, that
of the faithful began.1 The bishop, having once more
saluted the congregation with the words Dominus vobiscum!
calls upon them to pray: Oramus Ι It is a strange thing
that this exhortation was as barren of result in the eighth
century as it is in the present day. No one prayed. The
Pope and his assistants proceeded to collect the offerings of
the people and clergy, the choir executed some chant or
other, but no prayer was provided by the liturgical books, and
there was no rubric implying that any prayer was to be
said privately or secretly. There is, therefore, a hiatus here3
something has disappeared, and that something 15 nothing
else than the “ Prayer of the F aithful,'' which, in all other
liturgic& occurs at this place.

I am inclined to believe that the disappearance is not
altogether complete, and that the form used in ancient times
in the Roman Church is still preserved in the series of
solemn prayers employed on Good Friday.

’ In the eighth century these prayers were said, not only
on the Friday, but also on the Wednesday in Holy Week.
There is nothing in their tenor which connects them
especially with the solemnities of the Passion and of Easter.

¹ The custom of chanting the Grecd at this place in the Mass was not
introduced at Rome until the first half of the eleventh century. Bernon,
Abbot of Reichenau, relates that in his presence the emperor Hem-y II.
induced Pope Benedict VIII. (1012-1024) to adopt this custom3 before this
it was unknown to the Roman Church (De off. Missae, c. 2 ; Migne, Pat. Lat„
vol. cxlii. p. 1060).
