We must repeat again that these prayers, distributed
over the course of the day ,in somewhat different fashions,
are essentially private prayers. The bishop and the clergy‚
no doubt, were those who particularly observed them; but
before the fourth century we do not see them transferred
to the edifices where the public meetings of Sunday and
the stational days were held. They are not the spiritual
exercises of the community‚ that is, of the whole Christian
community of a particular locality. In the fourth century
the fact that they were adopted by the congregatione of
ascetics‚ that is, the monasteries, attracted special attention
to them. There was no monastery that did not have its
hours of prayer in common. As in many other matters,
there were in this respect, at first, great differences between
the religious houses themselves as well as between those
of different countries.2 In the fifth century the Egyptian
monks had merely the two primitive hours of morning
and evening, the Gallicinium and the Lucernarium. The
monks of Syria and Mesopotamia met together, in addition
to these, at the three day-hours of tiarae, sext, and none.
At Bethlehem, another office was added at the first hour
of day, to prevent the monks from retiring to bed after
the night office and sleeping during part of the morning.
This custom spread beyond the town of its origination‚
and thus occasioned six hours being set apart for prayer.
A verse of Psalm cxviii.‚* in which the psalmist says
to God that he prays to Him seven times a day, provides
a sort of ideal which it was attempted to realise by making
a distinction between the two parts of the office of Matins,

¹ It is a mistake to regard this daily prayer, as some have done, as a
poem composed in honour of the paschal candle.
