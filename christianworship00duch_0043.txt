of the Council of Elvira gives colour to this conjecture.l
Elsewhere, throughout the whole of the West, up to the
Danube and the Adriatic, no trace exists of ecclesiastical
divisions according to provinces or of metropolitan jurisdic-
tion in the Eastern sense of the word.

The Council of N icaea made special provision in its sixth
canon for certain cases which did not fall in with provincial
distribution. The chief exception was that of the Bishop of
Alexandria, who was accredited with powers to settle all
ecclesiastical affairs, especially ordinations‚ throughout the
whole of Egypt and in the two Libyan provinces. In
support of this exception, the example of the Bishop of
Rome was cited, who also exercised jurisdiction over a large
number of Churches without the mediation of metro-
politans. It is not stated precisely what were the privileges
granted in the case of the Bishop of Antioch, but his case
was specially considered. The council also mentions other
exceptions without indicatihg them by name. It is possible
that these were in Western Ohristendom, where, indeed,
other usages obtained. Moreover‚ the Council of Nicaea, like
all Eastern councils, even when they were oecumenicaL
legislated mainly for the East, and took but little heed of
what was passing in the West.

tradunt. It is not certain that prima cathedra episcopatus does not mean
simply the episcopal chair, in contradistinction to the plebes or parishes
established. in the towns or villages.
