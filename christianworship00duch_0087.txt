number of Syrian Greeks, or rather of the Christian popu-
lation using the Arabio language and following the
Byzantine rite, became incorporated in the Roman Gom-
munion at the end of the seventeenth century. These
constitute what are called the Greek Melchites. They are
organised into a patriarchate,1 whose titulary resides at
Damascus. Their entry into the Roman Communion, how-

Cyprus, are-—

liturgies of Constantinople are exclusively followed. The most
ancient witness to the existence of this liturgy is a mention
of it in the 32nd canon of the Council in Trullo (692), where
it is cited as being the actual production of St. James, the
brother of our Lord. It must go back, however, much beyond
the seventh century. The fact that the J acobites have
preserved it in Syriae as their fundamental liturgy proves

of Gregory XVI„ the head of the Melchite Church has been distinguished
by the title of Patriarch of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria. He is

represented in each of the two last cities by a vicar-
