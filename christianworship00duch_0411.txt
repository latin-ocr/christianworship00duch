the case 01 his successors. We see St. Gregory conferring
the pallium on the Bishops 01 Syracuse, Messina, Milan,
Salona, Nicopolis, Corinth, <Iustiniana Prima, Autun, Seville,
and Canterbury.

This mark of honour appears to derive its origin from
an Imperial gift. In the eighth century this was the
opinion 01 1116 forger 01 the Donation 01 Constantine, when
he makes that emperor bestow upon St. Silvester the
superhumerale, videlieet lorum qm' imperiale circumdare assolet
collum. In the sixth century, when the Popes granted the
pallium to bishops who were not subjects 01 1116 Greek
Empire, it was customary 101· 1116111 130 first ask the authori—
sation 01 1116 emperor.l The latter, morecver, claimed the
right 01 bestowing it directly, for in 1116 seventh century
we find Maurus, Archbishop 01 Ravenna, asking the
Emperor Constans ΙΙ. for it, and obtaining it. But thence-
forward such a step was regarded as equivalent to a revolt
against 1116 Pope’s supremacy. The Roman pallium gra-
dually acquired a symbolic significance. It was regarded as
a relic, that is, as a sort 01 replica of the mantle of St. Peter.
Before despatching it 10 its destination, it was deposited
for the whole of the previous night in the sanctuary 01 1116
Confessio, immediately above the tomb 01 1116 6Ρο6116. St.
Peter was regarded as having slept a night under this
mantle, and it thus became his own. By a very slight
extension 01 ideas it came to connote a kind 01 116116-
mission 01 power, like that symbolised by the mantle of

¹ This was what Vigilius did in the case of Auxanius and Aurelian,
Bishops 01 Arles; in the case of the other bishops, Sapaudus, Virgilius, and
Florian, no permission is recorded, and it is possible that in the end the
authorisation was granted in perpetuity for the Bishops of Arles. St.
Gregory asked it in the case of the Bishop of Autan, but does not appear
to have done 60 for those of Seville and Canterbury. The latter was,
however, a Roman monk, a subject of the Emperor Maurice, and Leander
of Seville had stayed at the Court of Constantinople, where he was well
known.
