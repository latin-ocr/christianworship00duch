7. The Missale Gothicum.²

This valuable manuscript bears the number 317 in
Queen Christina's collection in the Vatican. It came from

the Petau Library. From certain details which it contains,2
we are able to ascertain that it was drawn up for the Church
of Autun. Tommasi, who was the first to edit it, and
Mabillon‚ who published it after him, were 1110011601 in
thinking that its provencmwe was the province of Narbonne,
then subject to the Visigothic kings. This opinion appears
to have been suggested to them by a note written in
the fifteenth century as a heading 10 1116 manuscript:
Missale Gothicum. We must also be cautious in accepting
Mabillon's opinion that it represents the purus ordo yalli-
canus, As a fact, this 86016111611161)7 0011161116 many Roman
elements.

Two Masses are missing at the beginning, to judge by
the numeration of those which follow. The series, as it
stands, begins with the Mass for Christmas Eve. After the
Epiphany‚ we find certain Masses in honour of various saints,
then follow Lent and Easter, the festivals of the Invention
of the Holy Cross, of St. John 1116 Evangelist, the Rogation
Days, the Ascension‚ and Whitsuntide‚ and finally other
Masses in honour of saints, 6111161 special for certain festivals
or for the common of saints, and six Masses for Sundays.
