In Ireland the Host was divided in seven different
manners, according to the festivals 31 at ordinary Masses
into five particles‚ on the festivals of saints (confessors) and
virgins into seven, on the festivals of martyrs into eight,
on Sundays into nine, on the festivals of the Apostles into
eleven‚ on the kalends of January and on Thursday in
Holy Week into twelve‚ on the Sunday after Easter and on
Ascension Day into thirteen, and on the festivals of the
Nativity, Easter, and Pentecost, into sixty-five. They were
arranged in the form of a cross, with certain additional
complications when they were numerous. At the oom-
munion each of the parts of the cross, or of its additions,
was distributed to a special group of persons, that is, priests,
monks‚ etc.

During this ceremony the choir chanted an antiphon,
which was called in the Ambrosian Liturgy the (Jon-
frcwtorium. A chant of this character is implied in the
Mozarabic Liturgy, but in the books now in use it is
replaced by the recitation of the Creed. The following text
occurs only in the Stowe Missal; and it is to be noted that
it is not an antiphon, but a respond.

Fiat, Domine, misericordia tua super nos quemadmodum speravimus
in te.

Cognoverunt Dominum, alleluia, in fractione panis, alleluia.

Panis quem frangimus corpus est domini nostri Jesu Christi, alleluia.

Calix quem benedicimus alleluia, sanguis est domini nostri J esu Christi,
alleluia, in remissionem peccatorum nostrorum, alleluia.

Fiat, Domine misericordia tua super nos, alleluia, quemadmodum
speravimus in te, alleluia.

Cognoverunt Dominum, alleluia.

populo, quasi unicuique pro merito, aures, oculos, manus ac diversa singulis
membra distribui?”
