376 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

ξ 5.-0111111111116116 IN THE EAsr.

In dealing With the Eastern ceremonies‚ Ι will confine
my descriptions to those furnished by the Apostolie
Constitutions (viii, 4 εἰ seq), and by the De Ecclesiastica
Hierarolaia of Dionysius the Areopagite (c. 5).1

If the ordination is that of a bishop, the candidate
is presented to the congregation, at which several bishops,
surrounded by the local clergy‚ preside. The principal
bishop-that is, by right, the metropolitan or his substitute
—interrogates the congregation as to the identity of the
candidate and his qualifications, Is he the man of their
61161662 Η66 116 such and such a qualification for his
position? These questions are thrice repeated, and at the
third time with additional solemnity. The people were ex—
pected to reply in a loud voice, “ He is worthyl ’Ἄξιός ἐστιν.”

Then three of the bishops approach the altar. The
candidate kneels down, and while two deacons hold the
open book of the Gospels on his head, the presiding
bishop recites a consecrating prayer, eucharistic in form,
at the end of which comes the response, Amen.

The newly made bishop is then conducted to his seat,
receives the kiss of peace, and then celebrates the Mass
himself.

The same form is observed in the 6666 of priests,
deacons, deaconesses, subdeacons, and readers, with the
exception that the diocesan bishop alone presides at the
ceremony. The consecrating prayers are always accom-
panied by the imposition of hands.

Such is the ritual of the Apostolic constitutions? The

¹ The Euchologion of Sarapion has on]y the formularies: Χειροθεσία
καταστάσεως διακόνων (12) . . . πρεσβυτέρων (13) . . . ἐπισκόπου (14).

²Aster the reciting of the oonseorating canon over the bishop, the
author Of the Ap. Gonst. adds: ‘⁶ Εἷς τῶν ἐπισκόπων ἀναφερέτω τὴν θυσίαν ἐπὶ
τῶν χειρῶν τοῦ χειροτονηθέντας.” These words have no clear meaning to me.
