the Consecration of Altars, followed by eleven Masses, of
which the first is pro reqibug, the second in commemoration
of St. Hilary, the rest for the common of saints, or for
other purposes. The collection ends with the Canon aetionis,

manuscript itself at the Nobis quoque.

All the Masses contained in this Sacramentary are
Roman in style and ritual. Here and there, however, we
meet with a few Gallican rubrics, such as post prophetiam,
ante nomina. At the beginning, the ordination prayers
exhibit an unusual complexity, and in this section in-
teresting resemblances may be pointed out between the
Missale Francorum and the Gelasiau Sacramentary. Ι

to consult, has been lately published at Cambridge by Mr. Feltoe (Sacra-
