THE CHRISTIAN FESTIVALS. 27].

Α6 for the festival of the 24th of June, it appears to
have been of Western origin, like that of the 25th of
December.1 The earliest witness to its observance is to
be found in the sermons of St. Augustine.2 From the
middle of the fifth century onwards the existence of this
festival is attested in all our sources of information as
to Western usages. It appeared also at a very early date
at Constantinople and in the Byzantine East. There were,
however, places in which the ancient festival of January
held its own against the innovation. The Calendar of
Tours, belonging to the sixth century, represents a kind
of compromise3 the Natale of St. John is still retained
in the month of January‚ but the festival of June 16 6160
adopted, and, strange to say, as the anniversary of the Passio

of the saint.

The festivals of the Blessed Virgin, 66 they are now
observed both in the Latin and Greek Churches‚ have a
different origin and a different history from that of the
primitive commemoration which Ι have just dealt with.

The most ancient of these is that of the Presentation

of Christ in the Temple, which 16 generally called in
the West the festival of the Purification of the Blessed

precisely indicating the date. The genuine Roman books have no mention of
this festival: its appearance in the Gelasian Sacramentary is 611 indication
of one of the many revisions by Gallican hands to which this collection has
been subjected.

¹ It is to be noted that the festival is 011 1116 24111, 61111 not the 25th
of June; and we may well ask why the latter figure was 1101 adopted, since
it would have given the exact interval of six months between the Baptist
and Christ. The reason is that the calculation was made according 10
1116 Roman Calendar; the 24th of June is the viii. kal. jul„ just 66 1116 25111
of December is viii. kal. jan. At Antioch, where the calculation was made,
from the beginning to the end of the month the 25th would undoubtedly

have been chosen.
² Serm. 196 61111 287. It is not to be found in either the Philocalian

Calendar‚ or in that of Polemius Silvius (448). Owing 10 1116 present oon-
dition of the Syriae Menologion, we cannot say whether it was there or not.
