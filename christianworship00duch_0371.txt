ORDINATION. 345

seven ecclesiastical regions,1 and had apportioned them
among the same number of deacons. This apportioning
involved. soon afterwards a redistribution of the clergy,
which continued to exist for a long time afterwards,
namely, the distribution according to the seven regions.
John the Deacon, at the beginning of the sixth century,
expressly mentions this: Septem reqionibus ecclesiastica apud
nos militia continetur? The Ordines Romam· of the eighth
and ninth centuries are still olearer on this subject. It
should be noted, moreover, that the number of the regions
was, from the outset, not only equal to that of the deacons
and subdeacons‚ but that it also evidently affected that of
the acolytes‚ of whom there were forty-two‚ that 15, six to
each region. If we add to these the subdeacon, we have
in each region seven clerics under the rank of deacon‚
namely, the six acolytes and the subdeacon‚ who was a
kind of head acolyte.

eaque sacerdotibus ministrandi negata potestas 651, tantumque manus
impositioni vacent, propter quod exorcistae dicuntur, vel caetera quae intra
acolythorum ordinem 6556 probantur explere festinent. Acolythi vero
sacramentorum portanda vasa suscipiunt et ministrandi sacerdotibus ordinem

gerunt. Ideoque exorcista fieri potest acolythus; iste vero ad exorcistarum
officium nulla penitus promotione descendit.''
