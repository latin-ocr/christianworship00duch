132 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

principal instances, as Ι shall have to return to this subject
later on. At the end of the benediction of the sub-deacon
(I. 96) we find a formulary entitled Consecraiio manuum,
which is evidently out of place, for the consecration of
hands was never employed in the case of subdeaconS. This
formulary‚ momover, belongs to the rite of the ordination
of priests according to the Gallican use. It cannot pos-
sibly have been Roman. We know, indeed, from most
trustworthy documents, that the consecration of hands
did not form part of the ordination rites in use at
Rome. We are here confronted, therefore, with a Gallican
interpolation.

This is not an isolated instance. The whole of the ritual
of the minor orders, as it appears in sections 1„ 95, 96, of
the Gelasian Sacramentary, is Gallican from end to end.
It is headed by the rubric Incipit ordo de sacris ordinibus
benedicendis. NeXt follows an instruction with regard to the
conditions of age, etc„ for receiving orders, copied from the
decretal sent by Pope Zosimus to Hesychius of Salona.1
Then follow the first ten chapters of the Statum Ecclesiae
Antiqua, as to the ordination or installation of bishops,
priests, deacons, sub-deacons‚ acolytes, exorcists, readers,
doorkeepers, cantors, consecrated virgins. This document,
which is often assigned to the fourth Council of Carthage,
is in reality a decree of Gallican origin, promulgated 'in the
province of Aries towards the end of the fifth century. The
whole of the above serves as a preface to the Benedictiones
super 603 qui sacris ordinibus benedicendi suni, benedictions,
as we shall 000 later on, which were not in use at Rome at
all. The compiler who inserted this long excerpt, had before
him a Gallican text embracing all the various orders As far
as the benedictions are concerned, he restricted himself to the
forms connected with the minor orders, those for the maj0r
