the clergy. *In the same way, at Rome, we remark the
appearance of exorcists and doorkeepers. In the West
the exorcists had somewhat active functions in the
preparations for baptism, but in the East these functions
devolved on other clerics, the exorcists being regarded
ratherl as persons endowed with unusual supernatural
powers received direct from God, and not through the
medium of the Church. For this reason, therefore, they
were not included in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. As to
the doorkeepers, it was not thought suitable to rank among
the clergy persons engaged in so humble an employ-
ment.2

There were, therefore, two types of hierarchy, one
embracing five, and the other eight grades.

In the letter written by Pope Cornelius3 to Fabius,
Bishop of Antioch, in 251, we find a definite enumeration
of the Roman clergy. There existed at that time forty-six
priests, seven deacons‚ seven subdeacons, forty-two acolytos,
and fifty-two minor clerks (exorcists, lectors, doorkeepers)3
besides these there were more than fifteen hundred widows
or persons “assisted.'' We have here, including the Pope
himself, the eight orders of the Latin ecclesiastical hierarchy.4

² Beneath the rank, however, of subdeacon and lector, or rather outside
the hierarchy properly so called, the Eastern Churches recognised other
categories, some common to all Churches, the others varying according to
the localities and their special needs—-confessors, virgins, widows, psalmists,
doorkeepers, interpreters, comatae, parabolani, etc. Ap. const„ viii. 23-28;

⁴ The correspondence of St. Cyprian proves that at Carthage also, and
in the middle of the third century, all these different minor orders were
known, except perhaps that of doorkeeper, which I do not find mentioned.
But the omission of this order is explained by the few occasions which
St. cyprian and his correspondents had of mentioning it.
