time of Pope Hilary (arei-468), the chapel of the Cross,
behind the baptistery. Before entering the chapeL the
newly baptised first presented themselves before a priest,
who ancinted them on the head With the fragrant oil of
the holy chrism, saying—

peccatorum, ipsc te linit chrismate salutis in vitam aeternam.

The baptised then resumed their garments‚ or rather

brought before the bishop, they stood in groups‚ over

each of which the pontiff first pronounced the invocation

Spiritum consilii et fortitudinis, Spiritum scientiae et pietatis3 adimple
eos Spiritu timoris tui et consigna eos signo crucis Christi in vitam
propitiatus aeternam.2

The Pope then made the sign of the cross With his
