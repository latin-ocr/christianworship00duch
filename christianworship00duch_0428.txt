associated with the translation of the relies of the saint,
that is, with his taking possession of the monument
which he was henceforward to occupy.

There were, therefore, two kinds of churches, namely‚
the ordinary churches, which were merely places of meet-
ing for liturgical worship, and those in which the bodies
of the saints rested. The town churches belonged chiefly
to the former category‚ as did also many of the country
places of worship. The second type must have been re-
presented by but a small number of Christian edifices,
if they were limited to those actually constructed over the
tombs of the martyrs, relatively few in number, whose
memory and cult had been preserved. By a sort of
ritualistic fiction, however, it came soon to be recognised
that a single saint could have a great number of tombs.
Any relic whatever—a piece of lineri saturated with his
blood, a vessel containing 011 drawn from the lamps in
his sanctuary, a fragment of stuff detached from the
pall of his sarcophagus—was sufficient to represent
him at a distance from his resting-place. To possess an
object of this nature was to possess the body of the
saint itself. To translate it and depose it in a church
was equivalent to interring the body there.l Thus repre-

might be desired. In this way the churches with relies

of Milan, dedicated by St. Ambrose with the piynom of St. Peter and
St. Paul, which were brought from Rome. This dedication was prior to
the year 386 (Ambros. Ep.. 22; cf. Paulinus, Vita Ambr., 33). We must
recall also the basilica of the same apostles constructed by Rufinus in his
Villa of the Oak, near Chalcedon, and solemnly consecrated in the year 394
with relies also from Rome. But these instances are considerably less
ancient than that of which an African inscription of the year 359 tells us.
This was the case of a memoria in which there had been placed, in addition
to the relies of certain local martyrs, de Ziqno crucis, de terra promissionis ubi
natus est Christus, (piynora) apostoli Petri et Pauli (Audollent‚ in the
Melanqas de l’E'cole de Romf, vol. x. p. 441).
