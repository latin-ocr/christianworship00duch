THE Two LITURGIGAL usus or THE LATIN wnsr. 103

forth by Charlemagne in 789.1 The passage (cap. 80) reads
as follows :—

Omni clera—Ut cantum Romanum pleniter discant et ordinabiliter
per nocturnale vel gradale officium peragatur, secundum quod beatae
memoriae genitor noster Pippinus rex decertavit ut fieret, quando
Gallicanum tulit, ob unanimitatem apostolicae sedis et sanctae Dei
Ecclesiae pacificam concordiam.2

It was not, therefore, Charlemagne, as has often been
stated, but Pepin the Short, who abolished the Gallican
Liturgy. This reform had become necessary. The Frankish
Ghurch, during the reigns of the latest Merovingians, had
fallen into a sad state of corruption, disorganisation, and
ignorance. There was no religious centre anywhere, no
metropolis whose customs being better regulated and better
preserved might serve as a model and become the point of
departure for a reformation. The Visigothic Church had
a centre at ToledO, a recognised head in the metropolitan
of this town, and an unique disciplinary code—the Hispana
collection. The Liturgy of Toledo was then the liturgy
of the whole of Spain. The Frankish Church possessed
‚frontiers only, and lacked a capital. The Frankish Epis-
copate, except when the king or the Pope took the direc-
tion of it, was an acephalous episcopate.3 Each Church
possessed its book of canons and its liturgical use

Part L). Cf. the Epistola Generalis put forth between 786 and 800 (ibid,
p, 80): “Accensi praeterea venerandae memoriae Pippini genitoris nostri
exemplis, qui totas Galliarum ecclesias Romanae traditionis suo studio
cantibus decoravit.⁷'

³ This position never varied. It was the case before the Merovingians,
and continued so afterwards Every effort to establish in France an
ecclesiastical power superior to the bishops—apart from the Pope or
Government—-has invariably resulted in failure. The metropolitan authority
itself never enjoyed a strong position. The arehbishops are no longer
more than dignitarieS, and it would be easy to prove that, with a few
isolated exoeptions, they have never been anything more.
