Then follow some supplements, referring to peculiarities
in the service when the Pope is prevented from being
present, and also to special festivals or seasons of the
year. These supplements are peculiar to the St. Gall
manuscript, which forms the basis of Mabillon’s edition.
To these may be added Chapters 48-51, which are
also found in the Verona manuscript, and have the
same supplementary character. The description of the
ceremonies at the end of Lent and in Holy Week

Ordo I. in Mabillon⁷s edition. There are two redactions‚
the second more complete than the first, of the same
paschal Ordo, but they are not found in the same manu-
scripts.

journey which he made thither in 832 for the special purpose
of pursuing his liturgical studies. Pope Gregory IV. put
him into communication with his archdeacon‚ Theodooe,
who gave him all the information he required. It is
remarkable that on almost every occasion in which he
referred to the paschal ceremonies, the information of the
