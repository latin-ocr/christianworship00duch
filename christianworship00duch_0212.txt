As this work does not contain the parts sung, I have taken
the latter from the Mozarabic Missal.

By following my description, it will be possible to gain
an approximate idea of what a solemn Mass would have
been in the sixth century, say, at Milan, or Arles, or Toledo‚

or Paris.

1. Eottrgs of tlte Officiatz'ny Bishop.

GERMAIN: Antz'pltond ad praeleyendum canitur. . . .
Psallentz'bus clericis procedit sacerdos in specie Christi de
sacrario.

This Antiphon was specially intended to enhance the
dignity of the entry of the sacred ministers. It corresponds
in the Byzantine Liturgy, to the chanting of the Μουογευής,
and in the Roman Liturgy, to the Introit. At Milan it
was called the Inqressa, and at Toledo the Officium. The
following is the Mozarabic Officium for the Mass of the

Nativity 1 :—

Alleluia! Benedictus qui venit, alleluia, in nomine Domini. Alleluia!

Alleluia!
V. Deus Dominus et illuxit nobis.

Rp. In nomine Domini.
Ῡ. Gloria et honor Patri et Filio et Spiritui sancto in saecula saecu-

lorum. Amen.
RV. In nomine Domini.

GERMAIN z Silentium diaconus annuntiat. . . . Sacerdos
ideo datur populo ut dum ille benedicit plebem, dicens:
Dominus sit semper vobiscum, ab omnibus benedicatur

dicentibus: Et cum spiritu tuo.

¹ The psalm is reduced here, as in the Roman books, 10 a single verse.
Observe also 1118 form Gloria et honor Patri, etc. The words et honor were
already in 1118 seventh century characteristic of the Spanish use (Cone.

Tol„ iv. 14).
