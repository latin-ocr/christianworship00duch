338 CHRISTIAN wonsmr: 1Ts omem AND EVOLUTION.

Eastern Ghurch‚ as there was no distinction between the
anointing with chrism and the signing with the cross,
the priests possessed the right to perform the whole cere-
mony.1 There is ground for belief that this was also the
case in countries using the Gallican rite, and that, too, for
the same reason3 but the influence of Roman discipline
appears to have introduced some restrictions.2

ξ 5.-ΤΗΕ RECONCILIATION or HERErrcs.

The question as to how far Christian initiation was
valid when it was performed by an heretical sect had been
a subject of discussion even before the close of the second
century. Tertullian deals with it in his treatise on
baptism, or, rather, he refers to the solution of the question
which he had already given in a special book on the
subject, drawn up in Greek.3 According 130 him, initiation
performed by heretics separated from the Church has no
validity. A man who has been converted from paganism4
to an heretical sect, who has been initiated by the leaders

¹ In Egypt also, where, however, this distinction existed (Ambrosiasten
In Eph„ iv. 21; Quaest. Vet. et Nov. Testamenti, 101, in Migne, P. L„ vol.
xvii. p. 388, and vol. xxxv. p. 2302).

2 The letter of Innocent to Decentius, 0. 3, bears testimony to, while
inveighing against, the custom which allowed priests the right to confirm;
this custom is shown to have existed in Gaul by the Councils of Orange
(441, c. 1, 2) and of Epaone (517, 0. 16); and in Spain by the first Gouncil
of Toledo (400, 0. 20) and by the Gapitula Martini, 0. 52. For the con-
tention which took place in the Island of Sardinia, probably owing to the
clashing of the two uses, see Greg. Μ., Ep„ iv. 9, 26; cf. the epitaph of
Mareas (Lib. Pontzf, vol. i. p. 302, note 34).

³ De Baptismu, 15.

⁴ This is the only case here taken into account. That of the child
born of heretical parents and baptised in infancy into their sect must
have been fully covered by it. As to those Christians who, having left the
Ohurch to enter a sect, returned to their first saith and asked to be
received back into the community, they were made to do penance.
