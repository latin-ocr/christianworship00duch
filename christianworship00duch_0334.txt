310 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

Viryineo fetu yenitriae Ecclesia natos
quos spirante Deo concipit, amne parit.
Coelorum reqnum sperate, hoc fonte renem,-
non recipit felioc vita semel yenitoe.
Fons hic est vitae qui totum diluit orbem
sumens de Christi ‘vulnere principium.
Ilfferyere, peccator, sacro purqande fluento:
quem veterem accipiet proferet unda novum.
Insons esse volens isto mundare lavacro
seu patrio premeris crimine seu proprio.
Nulla renascentum es& distantia, quos facit unum
unus fons, unus spiritus, una fides.
Nec numerus quemquam scelerum neo· forma suorum
terreat: hoc natus flumine sanctus erit.

tall candelabrum of porphyry‚ ending in a golden bowl full
of baleam, in Which burnt a wiek of amianthus, diffusing ab
the same time both light and fragranee. On one of the sides
of ’0116 font stood two silvei* statues, one of Christ: and one of
St. John, having be'nween ’0116111 a golden lamb, with 0116
legend, Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qzn' tollit peecata mundi. From
beneath ’01116 lamb a jeb of water issued 11100 ‘ohe font, While
from the seven remaining sides as many streams of water
poured forbh from ’0116 heads of stage.
