he then invites them to incline their heads to receive the
blessing of the bishop, after which they are dismissed.

The same form is observed in regard to the energumens,
the competents, that is 10 say, the catechumens who are pre-
paring to receive baptism, and finaHy the penitents.

The faithful communicants, who are now alone in the
church, give themselves to prayer. Prostrating themselves
towards the east, they listen to the deacon while he says the
petitions of the Litany: “ For the peace and welfare of the
world . . . For the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church . . .
For the bishops, priests . . . For 13110 benefactors of the

peace, the direction of the eighth book appears to be confirmed by
St. Cyril, who speaks of the Pri-escrae immediately after the kiss of peace.
This is one of the places in which the liturg-ies differ most widely from
each other. In the Greek Liturgy of St. James there are two Litanies—
one before and another after the kiss of peace‚· but after the former the
procession of the oblaticii and the recitation of the Creed came immediately.
The Syriae Liturgy of St. James is on the whole in agreement with
St. Cyril and the eighth book of the Constitutions. In the Liturgy of
