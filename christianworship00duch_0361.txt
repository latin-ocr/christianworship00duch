OEREMONIES or CHRISTIAN INITIATION. 337

of lower rank, continued the administration of baptism,
but the subsequent ceremonies--the anointing, signing
with the cross, and imposition of hands—were reserved
for the bishop. At Rome, however, and at Alexandria,
doubtless on account of the length of the service, the
priests first poured the perfumed unguents (holy chrism)
on the head of the neophyte, thus reducing the Pope’s
function to the signing with the cross and the imposition
of hands.

When the local Churches became more numerous, and
dependent parishes had been thus created outside the epis-
copal city, it was necessary to cede to the priests of these
parishes the right of conferring holy baptism. But this
privilege was nowhere extended to them in its entirety.
The blessing of the chrism‚ and of the oils employed in
baptismal unction in general, was in all places interdicted
to priests, and they were therefore obliged to have recourse
to the bishop to obtain these elements ready consecrated.1
This restriction expressed symbolically the idea that none
could enter the Christian community without the personal
intervention of its supreme ruler.

Baptism with water, which, from the earliest times,
had been considered valid even when conferred by a
Christian layman, was reckoned among the offices of a
parish priest. The same was the case with regard to the
benediction of fonts, and even, in countries using the
Roman rite, to the anointing with chrism. In these
countries, the signing with the cross only, together with
the laying—on of hands, was reserved for the bishop‚ who
performed these functions either in the episcopal town
or on the occasion of his diocesan visitations. In the

performed by the patriarche only.
