Boons or THE LATIN RITE. 137

of October, but merely Masses de siccitate temporis and
super defunctos. In November we find the festivals of the
Four Orowns, of St. Cecilia, of SS. Clement and Felicitas,
Chrysogonus and Gregory‚ and also of St. Andrew. There
is no entry in the month of December until the Christmas
Masses, which are followed by the festivals of St. John the
Evangelist, the Holy InnocentS, and the winter Ember
days.

To what date are we to assign this collection?

It contains, at the end of the month of October, a prayer
composed for the burial or funeral anniversary of Pope
Simplicius, who died in 483, but this date would, Ι believe,
be far too early.

Many of the prayers, indeed, allude to the times in which
the Romans were besieged, surrounded by their enemies,
and exposed to massacre and pillage. Others express
thanksgiving to God after 6 victory or a deliverance.
Among the latter Ι would point out one which is the Secreta
of 6 Μ666 occurring in the month of July, and denoted by
the number 28. It will be seen that this Mass has no con-
nection with the month of July, but ought to be relegated
to Eastertide. This is but one out of numberless instances
of the disorder which characterises the whole collection.
The Secreta 16 as follows :—]1[unera nomini tuo, Domine,
cum qratiarum actione deferimus, qui nos ab infestis hosm'bus
liberatos paschale sacramentum secura tribuis mente suscipere.
The besieging and pillaging of Rome by Alaric, Genseric
and Ricimer, all took place in the summer months, and
therefore it cannot be to these attacks that the prayer
under consideration alludes, On the other hand, the
long siege by Vitiges, which lasted a whole year, was
raised in the month of March. In that year (538) Easter
Sunday fell on the 4th of April. The coincidence is
noteworthy.
