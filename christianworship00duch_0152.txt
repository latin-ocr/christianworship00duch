of the collection may be confirmed by a more careful study
of the manuscripts.

The most ancient of them, No. 316 of Queen Chris-
tina’s collection, is, in the opinion of Mons. Delisle‚1 “of
the seventh or beginning of the eighth century.'' This
opinion is confirmed by interna] evidence. We find, for
instance, no mention in it of the stations for the Thursdays
in Lent instituted by Gregory H. (715—731). The Roman
original was therefore earlier than the death of that Pope.
On the other hand, we find in it certain things which could
not have been introduced before the seventh century, viz. a
capitulum Sancti Greyoriz' papae2 (I. 21), the Wednesday‚
Friday, and Saturday stations before the First Sunday in
Lem, the four festivals of the Virgin, and that of the
Exaltation of the Cross. The latter five festivals are posterior
to the time of St. Gregory (d. 604) and earlier than Pope
Sergius (687-701) 3 3 that of the Exaltation must have doubt-
less been introduced after the discovery of the true cross
by Heraclius (628). We cannot therefore determine within
a century (628—731) the date of the Roman original of our
Sacramenta-ry.

I call it the Roman original. Ι ought rather to say the
Roman model, or framewoek, for the Gelasian manuscripts
are far from having preserved for us a Roman text, free
from all interpolations. In the most ancient copy all
topographical indications have disappeared. Not one of
the basilicas in Rome is mentioned. All the prayers
having reference to certain observances peculiar to Roman
ritual are likewise suppressed‚ such as the Mass of St.

² The name of St. Gregory occurs in the Canon of the Mass, where
it could not have been introduced until some time after his death. But
these are details which vary in the different manuscripts, and which we

cannot traco to the original with any certainty.
