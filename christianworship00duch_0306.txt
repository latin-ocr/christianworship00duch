282 CHRIsriAN woasHIP: irs omem AND EVOLUTION.

a festival in commemoration of a miracle which was
performed on the tomb of the apostle at Ephesus. This
miracle was known in Gaul, for Gregory of Tours makes
mention of it.1 In the Missale Gothicum there is a Mass
S. Johamw's Apostoli et Evangyelistcce between the festival
of the invention of the Cross (May 3) and the Rogation
days. The connection is closer, I think, between this
festival and that observed in the Greek church than
between it and the Roman Commemoration. But there
is nothing to prevent our believing that the latter, which
must have been instituted when Rome was under Byzantine
influence, had been itself determined by some consideration
of the solemnity at Ephesus.2

The festival of the ist of May in honour of SS. Philip
and J ames was also an anniversary of the dedication of
a church, namely, of that called the Holy Apostles at
Rome. This chureh, originally founded by Pope Julius
(337—352), was rebuilt about 561 by the Popes Pelagius Ι.
and John 111„ and placed under the names of the two
apostles Philip and James. The lst of May was fixed
upon for the day of the dedication, because the festival
of St. Philip was commemorated on this date.3 I am
unable to single out from the two or three apostles so
named, the J ames who was here associated with St. Philip,
The Hieronymian Martyrology mentions the festival of
St. Philip at Hierapolis in Phrygia, and an interpolation
occurs here of the name of St. James, who is thus placed
under a false topographioal rubrio. The Gallican liturgioal
books contain no mention of any festival commemorating
either St. PhiJip alone or associated With St. J ames,
