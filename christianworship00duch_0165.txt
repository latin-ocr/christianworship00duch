I am minimising matters; but it is useless to press the
matter further. This manner 01 putting one⁷s adversaries in
the pillory, 01 worse 111611 1116 pillory, is clearly foreign to the
recognised methods 01 the Roman Ohurch. The compiler
01 1116 Sacramentary could not have invented these strange
prayers, for it is scarcely possible 101 1116111 10 have been
composed in the sixth century. The use of the word con-
fessor in the sense implied, and especially the mention of
a still numerous pagan public, carries us back rather to
