550 APPENDIX.

Holy Places are not opened before cockcrow. Now as soon as
the first cock has crowed‚ the Bishop arrives and enters the
Cave at the Anastasis 3 all the doors are opened and the whole
multitude enters the Anastasis, where countless lights are already
burning. And when the people have entered, one of the Priests
says a psalm to which all respond, and afterwards prayer is
made 3 then one of the Deacons says a psalm and prayer is again
