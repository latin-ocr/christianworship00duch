232 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

every Saturday} The origin of the Roman Saturday fast is
usually referred to this weekly prolongation of the Friday.
The fast 011 Friday must in early times have trenched
on the Saturday‚ and when the practice of prolonging it
was found to be too severe, it was probably replaced by
another fast or semi—fast, distinct from that of the Friday.2

However this may be, it is certain that at Rome there
was 110 celebration of the Eucharist on Sami-days. Sozomen,
who on this point confirms the statement made by Pope
Innocent,3 adds that in this matter the Alexandrians were
in agreement with the Church of Rome.

We may sum up by saying that in addition to the two
meetings on Sunday, one for the Vigfl, and the other for the
Μ666, services were everywhere held on Wednesdays and
Fridays, but these services did not in all places include the
celebration of the Eucharist. At Rome and Alexandria
these were non-liturgicaL but in all parts of the East,
Alexandria excepted‚ the liturgy was used. As to the
Synaxis of Satmday, it was peculiar to the East, and was 6
later institution than those of the 'Wednesday and Friday.
