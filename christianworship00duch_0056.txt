and enlightenment. St. Martin and St. Augustine both
belong to this period. The real reason was that Milan
was the Imperial official residence, the capital of the
Western Empire. It had enjoyed this position from the
close of the preceding century, on the reorganisation of the
Empire under Diocletian and Maximianus. At the period
with which we are dealing its supremacy became more and
more accentuated. From the death of Maximus, in 388,
Treves had ceased to be the second capital. The importance

404 that the Emperor Honorius took up his abode there.
Even then a certain time must have elapsed before his
residence could have taken definite effect and have produced

the capital of the Empire. Constantius filled the see with an
Arian bishop named Auxentius, an able and energetic man,
who succeeded in maintaining his position after the defeat of

less then a lull in the competition of which the Imperial
Church was the prize‚ but the election of St. Ambrose was
soon to remove all difficulties and to shed a lustre upon the
see which should render it famous for all time.
