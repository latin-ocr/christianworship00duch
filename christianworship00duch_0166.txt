144 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

Ghurch. The brothers Ballerini‚ therefore, were perfectly
right in regarding the so-called Leonian Sacramentary as
a private collection exhibiting but little intelligence in the
manner in which it is drawn up and arranged.

This Sacramentary has nevertheless a very great value.
The formularies which I have just mentioned are relatively
few in number, and are the exception. With regard to
the others, what I have said above throws no doubt on
their Roman—indeed, exclusively Roman origin, and proves
that they go back to a time anterior, in some cases long
anterior, to the pontificate of St. Gregory.

5. The Roll of Ravenna.

Signor Ceriani published some years ago1 a liturgical
Roll belonging to the collection of Prince Antonio Pio os
Savoy. This parchment, which is 11 feet 9 inches in length,
in spite oi¹ its being mutilated at the beginning and ending,
contains, in large uncial characters, forty prayers, of the
Roman type, relating to the preparation for the festival of
Christmas. On the back of the manuscript have been
copied,2 in minuscules of the tenth century, seven letters
of an Archbishop of Ravenna named John, and another
from Pope Sergius ΠΙ. These eight documents all belong
to the period 900-910. The letter of Pope Sergius was
written in the interests of the Church of Ravenna, and the
archbishop acknowledges, in one of his replies, that he
has read it. We have, therefore, ground to believe that
the whole of this correspondence came originally from the

1883. This memoir has been re-edited in the Ambivio Storico Lombardo,
1884, p. 1, et seq.

the Neues Archiv„ vol. ix. p. 515, et seq„ with an historical commentary.
