4. Baptism.

The “elect '’ were present at the solemn vigil of Easter.
The lections2 chosen for the occasion were meant to present
a summary of the relations between man and God, and
to form, as it were, a final instruction at the moment of
the accomplishment of the mystery of initiation. These
lections are practically the same in all the Latin rituals.
Some of the finest passages in the Old Testament are
presented in them—such as the account of the Creation,
the Deluge, the Sacrifice of Isaac, the Passage of the Red
Sea, the Vision of Ezekiel, the History of Jonah, the
account of the image set up by Nebuchadnezzar; then
some passages from the prophets, as, for instance, that in
which Tsaiah predicts baptism, and extols the vine of the
Lord3 also that dealing with the covenant of Moses and
the institution of the Passover. Each one of these lections
is followed by a prayer.3 Canticles of a like impert are

¹ Ι have given here the prayers common to the Gelasian Sacramentary
and that of Adrian, but using the text of the former, on account of its better
preservation. As for the ritual, I have described that 111 the Ordines, with
which the Sacramentary of Adrian is in full agreement. In the (1101351311
smo1ament2ry there is found' ln the first place the prayer Deus incrementorum,
and the consecratory formulary Deus qni in principiO, both of which there-
fore seem to have reference to the same ampulla, that of the holy chrism-
But the former of these prayers is evidently out of place, for it was drawn
up in reference to the 011 intended for the anointing which precedes
baptism, whilst the other has in view the anointing which follows it.
After the consecrating formulary comes an exorcism of the 011 together
with a eucharistie prayer. These two do not seem to fall in with the
ritual of the Ordines, and it is possible that they are Gallican, and not
Roman, in origin.

² At first there were twelve lections, as we see from the Gelasian
Sacramentary. Only four are found in the Sacramentary of Adrian, but
the ancient custom, which had been maintained in France, was restored
later on at Rome.
