CHAPTER XIII.

THE CONSECRATION OF VIRGINS,

ᾗ 1.-ΤΗΕ PROFESSION oF Vmems.

THE different forms taken by the ascetis life in Christian
antiquity succeeded one aster another in the following
sequence.1 In the earliest times individual asceticism was
practised without its involving separation from the ecclesi-
astical community and family life, or absence from the city
and ordinary avocations. Experience having subsequently
shown the difficulty of reconciling such conflicting duties‚
ascetics “retired from the world‚'' and sought silence and
solitude away from human habitations. This second stage
is that of mones, or isolated auotoritas. Finally, these
ascetics or anchorites conceived the idea of living together,
of forming groups of individuals drawn exclusively from
persons of their own calling, isolated from the “world‚''
and even from ordinary Christians. It was thus that the
coenobitic life took its origin.

It is merely with the first stage that I have to deal here,
namely, that of the ascetics attached to the local church
without segregation of any kind. Their ranks were recruited
from both sexes, even at an early period; we note their
presence even in the second century under various names,
such as ascetae, eunuchs, continentes, encratitae, etc. The

¹ I have given the logical, which is, in the main, also the chronological
order.
