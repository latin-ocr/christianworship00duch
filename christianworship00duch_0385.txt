3. The Ordination of Bislzops.

We have seen that in the ordination of deacons and
priests the entire rite, according to Roman usage, consists of
prayers——some offered in common by the whole congregation,
and others recited by the Pope over the prostrate candidate.
The ceremonial in the case of bishops was not more complex,

The bishops consecrated by the Pope were almost
always those of his own metropolitan province. They were
not chosen by him, but elected in their several 1006110166.
The election being over, an official report or decree is drawn
up, which is signed by the notables of the place, both clerical
and lay, and the future bishop thereupon sets out, accom-
panied by some representatives of his Church‚ for Rome,
where the election is verified and the candidate examined.
If the electionis found to have been regular, and the Pope
approves of the choice of the electors‚ the consecration
follows. There was no special time in the year assigned to
this ceremonial, but it had always to take place 011 6

Asywas the case in the ordinations at the Ember seasons‚

the Litany and Kyrie were deferred until after the Gradual.
When this had been sung, the Pope called on the congre-
gation to pray, and then all present prostrated themselves
while the Litany was being chanted. After the Litany, the
Pope arose and recited over the candidate a prayer composed
of two formularies, of exactly the same type as that used
for deacons and priests, The new bishop then arose, and
having received the embrace of the Pope, bishops, and
priests, took his place at the head of the bishops. The
choir then sang the Alleluia, or Tract, and the Mass was
continued in the usual manner. I append here the special
formularies used for the ordination of bishops :—-
