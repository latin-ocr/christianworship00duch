SALARIA. This last festival is that of the dedication of a
Church in the environs of Rome. Another dedicatory Mass
in honour of St. Stephen is found among the Masses for
the month of August;1 it must be referred either to the
Church on the Via Latina, or to that on the Coelian. The
Preface of one of these Masses, in honour of SS. John and
Paul,2 takes for granted that the officiating priest is at
Rome and in the Church dedicated to the two martyrs.
The same remark is applicable to the Masses in honour
of the apostles Peter and Paul, and many others. Among
the services for the departed,3 several formularies presuppose
that those present are at San Lorenzo fuori le mura, and

that the prayers are offered for one of the Popes interred
in that Church.4 It is unnecessary to press the point
further. The Roman origin of this collection is clearly
evident.

On the other hand, We must beware of regarding it
as an official book. It is a private compilation, in which
various materials of different age and authorship have
been gathered together without much attempt at order.
We find in it, indeed, the Stational Masses for the
great festivals and for the Ember days, but besides these
necessary offices there is a vast amount of superfluous
matter. In the other Sacramentaries, the compilers
have confined themselves to giving one Mass for each
station. In the Gelasian we sometimes find two prayers
where 13116 Gregorian gives only one (p. 141), but one of
these 16 merely 6 variant, or an alternative prayer. In the
