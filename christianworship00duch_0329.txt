CEREMONIES OF CHRISTIAN INITIATION. 305

recitation of the symbol (Redditio sfflnbolz').1 The ceremony

being over, the candidates prostrated themselves in prayer,
and were dismissed by the archdeacon.

3. Blessiozgy of the Holy Oils.

It is necessary here to go back a little. While the
candidates were completing their preparations‚ the Ghurch
was making its arrangements to receive them. On the
Thursday in Holy Week the chrismal Mass was celebrated,
at which the holy oils were consecrated for use in the
ceremony of initiation. They were prepared in two separate
vessels (ampullae), one of which contained nothing but pure
oil, and the other oil rendered fragrant by a mixture of
balsam. It was the Pope himself who poured the balsam
into the oil in the sacristy before the Mass. During the
ceremony the two vessels were held by clergy of the minor
orders standing before the altar.

The Mass was celebrated with a high ceremonia] on
account of the solemnity of the day. Towards the end of
the Canon the faithful brought small vessels of oil to be
blessed for their own use. This was the oil for anointing
the sick, and the faithful could make use of it them-
selves. It served also for extreme unction. The vessels
containing it were placed on the balustmde, or podium,
which separated the sacred precincts from the rest of the
building. From this place some of these vessels were taken
by the deacons and brought to the altar, where the Pope
blessed them, using the following formulary 2 :—

Week that the candidates knew the Creed by heart.
