134 CHRISTIAN wonsmr: 1Ts ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

the expression post clausum Paschae, applied to the Sundays
between the octave of Easter and the festival of Pentecost.
This term is found in the Missale Gothicum and in the
Lectionary of LuxeuiL both of them Gallican books, Gregory
of Tours uses it,1 but it is not met with in the books of
purely Roman type.

These details are sufficient to show that the Gelasian
Sacramentary cannot be regarded as affording uniform
evidence to the customs of the Roman Church. It is, both
as regards its origin and its text as a whole, a Roman book,
but one which has undergone many modifications in a
Gallican direction.

3. The Missale Francorum.

The Missale Francorum should be assigned a place beside
the Gelasian Sacramentary. This manuscript is now in the
Vatican? and figures as No. 257 in the collection of Queen
Christina. Before it found its way into the Petau Library,
from whence it passed into that of the Queen, it had lain
for a considerable time in the Abbey of St. Denis, where
it was known as early as the thirteenth century. It is
written in uncials, and must be attributed to the end of the
seventh or the beginning of the following century. Its
Frankish origin is undoubted. In the State prayers‚ the
reqnum Francorum has everywhere been substituted for the
Roman Empire.

This manuscript is merely a fragment. It contains,
first, Ordinations‚ the Benediction of Virgins and Widows,

¹ Gloria Co‘nf„ 47.
² Delisle‚ op. cit„ No. 4. The text has been published by Tommasi
(op. ciffi), by Mabillon, in his De Litarqia Gallicana, and by Muratori

(op. aa).
