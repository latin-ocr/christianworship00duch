CEREMONIES or cHRIsTIAN INITIATION. 317

1. The Oatechumenate.

The ritual of the catechumenate consisted of three
ceremonies—exorcism‚ unctiori, and insufflation.

Exorcism is mentioned by Isidore and Ildefonsus. One
rather curicus formulary, preserved in the Missale Galli-
canum, probably refers to this ceremony 1 :

Adgredior te, immundissime, damnate spiritus, etc.

The unction‚ mentioned also by Spanish writers, is
specially that of the ears and mouth. In this respect it
corresponds to the Roman Effeta, but it was also applied
to other parts of the body, and in this case it corresponds to
the unction of the breast and shoulders, which, in the Roman
rite, follows immediately after the Effeta. We have here, then,
at the very beginning of the catechumenate, the ceremony
which, according to the Roman use, terminates that period
of probation, and immediately precedes the renunciation of
the devil.2 Finally, this anointing is accompanied by the

¹ St. Isidore, De Off, ii. 21, adds to exorcism the administration of salt:
“Exorcizantur, deinde sales accipiunt et unguntur.” But this ceremony
was not universal in Spain, as Ildefonsus (De coquit. baptismi, 26) says it
was observed in some places, but that he disapproved of the custom. It
was used, perhaps, in the province of Boetica, and was a vestige of the
Roman use, which in that country had preceded the Gallican.

2 St. Ildefonsus mentions the unction as immediately following the
exorcism (op. cit„ c. 21, 27, 28). He refers the origin of this custom to
the healing of the <leaf and dumb by the Ephphatha and the anointing with
the saliva, citing in support St. Mark vii. 32, 33; 116 says also that this
passage from the Gospel was read at the Mass during which the exorcism
took place. All this shows that it is clearly the Gallican Effeta which is
in question. The same writer, indeed, specifies (c. 29) that ‘⁶ post exorcismos
tanguntur auriculae oleo . . . tangitur et os,'' and all this before the
traditio of the Creed, at the moment when from being qentilis the person
became catechumenus.
