such as Baptism, Ordination‚ 0130. The first of the three
liturgies, that of St. Basfl, is the only one which bears
on it the name of its author, the two others are anony-
mous.1 In this ancient manuscript the prayers to be
said by the celebrant only are given, the litanies to
be said by the deacon not being included, nor, of course,
the lections and hymns. It contains but few rubrics.
This arrangement closely recalls that of the Latin Sacra-
mentaries. The later manuscripts, of the twelfth century
and onwards, are much more complete.

There is no doubt that the Liturgy of St. Basil is
the most ancient of the three. The text we possess of
it 15 attested as early as the beginning of the sixth
century. In a letter addressed about 520, by the monks
of Scythia to the African bishops in exile in Sardinia,2 We
find a passage from 113 quoted at length.

The Armenian Liturgy‚ evidently derived from that of
Caesarea and Constantinople, may be regarded as representing,
in certain respects, an ancient stage of the Byzantine Liturgy.

¹ Mr. Brightman has published (op. cit„ p. 309, et seq.) the three
liturgias according to the Barberini manuscript, which gives the use
of the ninth century or thereabouts; in addition to this, he gives the two
liturgies of St. Chrysostom and of St. Basil, following the texts now in
1150. Ηο has also collected and classified (p. 518, et seq.) a certain number
of texts which are useful in giving an idea of the development of the
Byzantine Liturgy.

² Migne, P. L„ vol. lxv. p. 449. “Hinc etiam beatus Basilius Caesari-
ensis episcopus in oratione sacri altaris quam paene universus frequentat
Oriens, inter caetera: Dona, inquit. Domine virtutem ac tutamentum ,· malos
quaesumu8‚ bonos facito, bonos in bonitate conserva. Omnia enim potes ei
non est qui contradicat tibi. Cam enim volueris salvas et nullus resistit
voluntati tuae.”
