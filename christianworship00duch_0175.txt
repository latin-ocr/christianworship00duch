Holy Week, the festivals of Easter, and the continuation
of the proper of the time up to the Mass for Rogationtide‚
where the text breaks off

In the passages where this Sacramentary can be com-
pared with the preceding one, many identical formularies
are met with. N either of these Sacramentaries is complete.
In order to reconstruct certain series of prayers, it is
necessary to supply the 0011551005 of one from the other.
There is, moreover, here, as in the Autun Sacramentary,
a large proportion of Roman 616106οῖ5.

9. Masses published by Mane}

In 1850, Herr Mone2 published a collection of eleven
Gallican Masses, deciphered in a palimpsest manuscript
found at Reichenau. The script is uncial, of the end of the
seventh century.3 According to a note added at a later
date to the end of the manuscript, it belonged to John
H„ Bishop of Constance (760-781).

These texts have this advantage over the preceding
Sacramentaries, they are entirely Gallican, without any
admixture of Roman elements. Unfortunately, with the
exception of a Mass 10 honour of St. Germain of Auxerre,4
all the others are Masses for ferial days, or Sundays
without ascription to any special festival. There are two
contestationes, or prefaces‚ to each Mass, offering an alter—
native to the officiating priest. One of the Masses is in
hexameter verse throughout, a peculiarity unique 10 the
whole of the liturgical texts known up to the present time.
