&orarem—The bishop hands to the candidate the book
of exorcisms, sayino—

Accipe et commenda, et habeto potestatem imponendi manum super
energumenum, sive baptizatum sive catechumenum.

Then follows the blessing—

Deum Patrem omnipotentem supplices deprecemur, ut hunc famulum
suum nomine Illum benedicere dignetur in officium exorcistae, ut sit
spiritalis imperator ad abiciendos daemones de corporibus obsessis cum
omni nequitia eorum multiformi.

Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus, benedicere digneris
famulum tuum hunc nomine mam in officio exorcistae, ut per imposi-
tionis manuum et oris officium eum eligere digneris, et imperium habeat
spiritus immundos coercendi¹ et probabilis sit medicus Ecclesiae tuae,
gratiae curationum virtute confirmatus.

Aeolytes.—The order of acolytes seems not to have been
everywhere in use in Gallican countries. The Statum?
doubtless, describe their ordination like that of the other
orders, but the Gelasian Sacramentary omits the formularies
of blessing. In the Missale Francorum a prayer only is
found, and that, too, without an invitatory‚ and in an unusual
place, viz, between the blessing of the doorkeepers and that
of the lectore. At Rheims, in the fifth century, there were
no acolytes.3 In the collection of Irish canons, the acolyte
is not reckoned among the seven ecclesiastical degrees3 he
is placed with the psalmist and cantor, outside the ordinary

¹ The two manuscripts have spirituum immundorum coercendo (coer-
cendum, Miss. Fr.) I correct it from the Pontifical and the Missale Fr.
The Gelas. Sacr. has higher up oris in officium. The words eum eliyere
diynerz's et seem superfluous. They do not occur in the Pontifical.

² The Statum, drawn up at Ades, give us the ,usage of the most
important Churches in Gaul.

³ The will of Bishop Bennadjus, predecessor of St. Remigius, gives all
the categories of clerice except this one (Flodoard Hist. Rem„ i. 9).
