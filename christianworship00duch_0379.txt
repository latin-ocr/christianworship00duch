ORDINATION. 353

ceremony consisted of a simple blessing, of the same tenor
as that just given, and without any special reference to
the conferring of either honour or authority. This for-
mulary of blessing‚ moreover, has no very ancient ring
about it. I do not think it is older than the seventh
century. John, the Roman deaccn, speaks at the be-
ginning of the sixth century of the traditio of the
chalice as constituting the whole ceremony in the ordination
of subdeacons.1

2. The Ordinations at the Ember &asom—that is, of
Priests and Deacons.

The ordinations of deacons and priests were also per-
formed with a very simple ritual, but they were celebrated
with great publicity at a solemn station. There was not
an ordination every year, but when the necessity arose one
of the Saturdays of the Ember weeks was always chosen.2

The candidates for ordination, chosen by the pope, were
at first presented to the faithful during the Stational Masses
of Wednesday and Friday in Santa Maria Maggiore and
in the Church of the Holy Apostles. Shortly after the
beginning of Mass, a notary, mounting the ambo, announced
the names of those who had been elected, and called
upon those who had anything to say against them to do
50 without sear——

Auxiliante Domino Deo Salvatore nostro Jesu Christo, elegimus
in ordine diaconi (sive presbyteri) illum subdiaconum (sive diaconum)
(de titulo illo). Si quis autem habet aliquid contra hos viros, pro Deo

¹ ‘⁶ Cujus hic apud 1105 01·ἃο est ut accepto sacratissimo calice . . . sub-
diaconus jam dicatur '' (Migne, Pat. Lat, vol. lix. p. 405).

2 It appears that, at the beginning, and up to the end of the fift'r,
century, the December Ember days were chosen by preference, for the
Liber Pontzflcalis mentions the ordinations as celebrated almost always

mense decembri.
