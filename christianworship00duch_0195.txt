THE ROMAN MASS- 173

They are prayers for the ordinary needs of the Ohurch, for
peace, for the bishop, for the whole hierarchy down to the
confessors (ascetae), virgins, and widows3 for the Roman

Roman Mass, and that they were said after the lection, that

on Wednesday and F riday in Holy Week.1

and priests, received the loaves; the archdeacon and his
colleagues the amulae, or phials of wine. This distinction
of functions was observed throughout the entire ceremony,
the species of wine being considered as within the special
province of the deacons.

During the offering the choir chanted a responsory psalm,
called the Offertorz'um. This chant is of ancient use. It was

¹ The prayers used now between the Gospel and the Homily or Sermon,
called Prayers of the P cccccccc ium, correspond with this ancient prayer of
the faithful. [Bidding Prayer.-—TR.]

still preserved at Milan, and in certain places in France. Ἴ
