the Sacramentary other allusions which may be explained
far more satisfactorily by attributing them to the anxiety
felt during the siege of 537-538 than to any other occasions.
Thus we find, for example, in the Preface of another Mass

in the month of July (xviii. 6), the following words :—
Aqnoscz'mus Domine . . . ad peccantium merita pertinere ut

servorum tuorum labore quaesita sub conspectu nostro manibus
diripiantur alienis, ct quae desudantibus famulis nasci tribuis,
ab hostibus patiaris absumi. In the year 537 it was the
Goths who reaped the harvest on the Roman campagna,
and from the tops of the city walls the Romans must have
watched with sorrow the operation by which the fruit of
their own labour passed into the hands of the besiegers.
It is for other reasons quite impossible to assign this prayer
to the time of Alaric and Genseric. It was the city rather
than the campagna that suffered from the pillaging of the
Visigoths and the Vandals. Had it referred to them, we
should certainly find somewhere in that long list of Masses
tempore hostili, some allusions to the sack of public buildings,
churches, and private houses. When these invaders, more—
over‚ appeared before the walls of Rome, the season was
too far advanced for the harvesting to be still proceeding.
On the other hand, everything can be satisfactorily explained
by the hypothesis that it refers to the Ostrogoths and
the siege of 537—538. On the other hand, however, as the
Romans were often besieged during the wars with the
Goths‚ and later on during the Lombardic invasion, I
would not like to affirm that it was this particular siege by
Vitiges that was actually in question. The latter is the
earliest to which we can assign it, and I do not press the
point further.

The earliest limit having been thus determined, it
remains to be seen whether a more definite one can be
found for the latest date than that furnished by palaeography.
I do not think that we need look later than the time of
