442 OHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

I may here make a passing reference to an ancient
office known as the ceremony of Indulgence, which took
place in Spain on Good Friday, the same day on which
apparently the solemn reconciliation of penitents was held
from very early times at Milan.1 This ceremony was pre-
scribed by the fourth Council of Toledo (633)‚2 and all the
details of it are found in the Mozarabic Missal.

After a few preliminaries, among which are the re-
proaches, Popula meus, quid feci tibi, now forming part of
our Good Friday service, the office begins by three lessons,
one-drawn from the Prophets (Isa. 111. 53), 0116 from the
Epistles (l Cor. v, 6), and one from the Gospels. It was
the Gallican custom, as we 366 also from the Lectionary
of LuxeuiL to read 1116 Passion from a composite text, a
sort of Diatessamn, in which the narratives of the four
evangelists were combined. This consecutive account was
distributed between the various offices of Maundy Thursday
and Good Friday. At the service of Indulgence this lection
began by the words, fiscane autem facto, cena pura, eonsilium
inierunt.3 After these lections followed the actual ceremony
called the Indulgence. Those present, who are indis-
criminately described as penitents„ are 1111106 invited to

¹ This follows, 1 think, from St. Ambrose⁷s twentieth letter: “Erat
autem dies quo sese Dominus pro nobis tradidit, quo in Ecclesia paenitentia
relaxatur.⁷’

² Gan. 6: “Oportet eodem die mysterium crucis, quod ipse Dominus
cunctis annuntiandum voluit, praedicare atque indulgentiam criminum
clara voce omnem populum postulare, ut paenitentiae compunctione mundati
venerabilem diem dominicae Resurrectiouis remissis iniquitatibus suscipere
mereamur, corporisque ejus et sanguinis sacramentum mundi a peccato
sumamus.’‘

² Matt. xxvii. 1. The words cena pura, which do not form part of the
text of Holy Scriptum, are a very ancient designation of Good Friday.
They are met with in a book on the paschal computation drawn up at
Rome in the fourth century (Krusch‚ Der 84jiihriqe Ossa-cyclus, p. 234).
The text Mane autem facto is assigned in the Luxeuil Lectionary 10 1116
office of Secunda, a morning office, corresponding 1ο that of Prima, in the
Roman hours.
