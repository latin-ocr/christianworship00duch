ext-ended to the ninth week before Easter. At Con-
stantinople also three Sundays were added, and associated
with the festival of Easter in the same way as the
seven Sundays in Lent properly so called.¹ The first two
are designated by the names of the Gospels read at Mass
on these days, that is, the Sunday of the Pharisee and the

Cheese Sunday (τῆς Τυροφοίγου), because from this day forward the Lenten
fast excludes milk-products.

³ This is still the custom in the Ohurch of Milan. Lent begins at
Milan not on Ash Wednesday, but on the Snnday following.
