BOOKS or THE LATIN RITE. 131

Anastasia for Christmas Day, the Grreater Litany (April
25), the processions at the Easter vesperS, and the collects
on certain festivals. These belong to the course of the
ecclesiastical year at Rome, and are essentially Roman
formularies, though appropriated to the use of other
countrieS.

The Sacramentary known as No. 316 was drawn up in
France, probably for the Abbey of St. Denis, whose three
patrons are mentioned in the Canon of the Mass, before St.
Hilary and St. Martin. The two other manuscripts, those of
Rheinau and St. Gall, are also Frankish in origin. It is in
Franco, moreover, that we find the manuscripts which the
Carlovingian liturgiologists made use of to supplement
the Sacramentary of Adrian. These manuscripts, with the
exception of that of St. Gall, agree in employing certain
significant variations in the prayers for the Sovereign in
the office for Good Friday. The Sacramentary of Adrian
mentions the Roman Emperor only, and does not asso-
ciate with him the Frankish Sovereign. In the Gelasian
Sacramentary, the formularies are modified as follows :—
Oramus et pro christianissimo imperatore VEL REGE NOSTRO
illo. . . . Respice propitius ad Romanum SIVE FRANCORUM
benignus imperium}

The modifications, however, are not limited to the
suppression of peculiarities relating to the city of Rome, and
to the region subject to the Empire. There are others,
of a purely liturgical nature, which indicate a combination
of the Roman and Gallican uses. These are mostly met
with in the rite of Ordination. Ι will merely point out the

¹ The correction was not made at first in the text of the Masses
Tempore belli et Pro reqibus, which figure in the third book of the Gelasian
Sacramentary under the Nos. 57-62. The prayers in these Masses almost
all recur in the supplement of the Gregoriau Sacramentary, Nos. 83-87.
With a single exception, No. 83, the word Christianus is always found

substituted for that of Romanus.
