THE CONSECRATION or VIRGINs. 423

given as early as the twenty-fifth year 3 ¹ in Spain
about the same time, the woman had to wait till her
fortieth year.2 This latter limit helped to obviate many
difficulties, and a law of 4583 officially sanctioned it.
In this manner the velatio lost much of its significance.
Instead of being the inaugural act of a career, it was
merely its crowning-point. Under the pretext of securing·
the fidelity of the spouses of Christ, they were only
dedicated to Him at an advanced age. Popular opinion,
it must be remembered, favoured this arrangement, and
had even gone further in that direction, since some
apocrypha] writings protest that the age should be sixty
or even seventy—two years4

The performance of the ceremony of the ‘velatio was, like
ordination, reserved for the bishop. It took place with great
pomp on some solemn festival. In the curious discourse
entitled Ad vioyinmn lapsam, which appears among the
works of St. Ambrose,5 the bishop reminds a virgin, who
has lapsed, of her solemn consecration on Easter Day,
surrounded by the white-robed neophytes holding lighted
tapers. At Rome the solemn festivals chosen for the
purpose were Christmas Day or the Epiphany, Easter
Monday, and St. Peter's Day,6 on which occasions the
Station was held at the basilica of the Vatican.

⁰ Deoretal of Gelasius (Jaffiss, 636), ch. 12, compared with a rubrio of
the Gelasian Sacramentary (i. 103). These texts do not mention the
festival of Christmas; Marcellina was, however, consecrated on that day.
It is possible that when the observance of the Epiphany was introduced at
Rome, which was not, Ι believe, till aster Liberius, that the oeremony of
the velatio virginum was transferred to that festival.
