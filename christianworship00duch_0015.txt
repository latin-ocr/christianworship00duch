TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.

THE translator has to thank several friends for
looking over the proof-sheets while the work was
passing through the press, and among them the
Rev. Canon F. E. lVarren, RD„ F.S.A.‚ whose
extensive liturgica] knowledge has been freely
drawn upon whenever a difficulty arose as to
the English equivalents os technieal terms.

Since the third edition of this work was published
a few weeks ago in Paris, Mgr. Duehesne has
contributed some additional notes to the English
version, in order to meet certain late criticisms.
With these exceptionS, and the addition of a few
short notes by the translator marked [TR.], the
English edition represents the Frenoh original in its

integrity.

Ulc‘rz‘simas, 1902.
