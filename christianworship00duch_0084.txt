The communion ended, the deacon gives the sign for
prayer, which the bishop offers in the name of all. The people
bow to receive his blessing, and are finally dismissed by the
deacon with the words, “ Depart in peace.''

ᾗ 3.-ΤΗΕ ORIENTAL LITURGms.

The Liturgy of the Apostolic constitutions cannot be
considered as the normal and official Liturgy of any distinct
Church. It can be proved that its formularies did not
pass into the texts adopted later 00 as the Official Use. But
if, from the point of view of its purport, it cannot be con-
sidered more than a private composition, it is otherwise with
the ritual which it implies, and with the arrangement of the
prayers‚ their style and general tenor. In regard to these,
we must recognise in it an exact representation of the use of
the great Churches of Syria, Antioch, Laodicea, Tyre, Caesarea,
and Jerusalem. The most trustworthy documents, in that
which concerns Antioch and Jerusalem, furnish us here with
completely convincing evidence. Among these documents
we must not only assign a place to the texts of St. Gyril of
Jerusalem and of St. John Chrysostom, but we must also
take into our reckoning the Syrian liturgies of later
centuries. All these are, indeed, of the same type as the
Liturgy of the Constitutione, allowance being made, as a
matter of course, for the additions and the greater com-
plexity of the rites and prayers which have been incor-
porated into it in the course of time.

This brings me 10 speak of the area in which the Syrian
Liturgy was used, of its spread, to a varying extent, through-
out the whole East, Egypt emepted, and finally of the
documents containing it.
