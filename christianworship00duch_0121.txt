THE TWO LITURGICAL USES OF THE LATIN WEST. 101

us date back to the last period of the Merovingian
rule. Nearly all of them contain formularies of Roman
origin and Masses in commemoration of Roman saints.
As early as the time of Gregory of Tours, the Hierony—
micm Martyrologsy, a book of Roman origin, though not
of an official nature, was introduced into Gaul and adapted
to the Use of the country. The Sacramentary of St. Denis,
known as the Gelasimo sacramentam—a work which is,
in fact, fundamentally Roman—was drawn up at the
latest in ’1116 time of Charles Martel. Some other books,
or fragments of books, of both Roman and mixed origin,
belong to this period, that is to say, to a time when the
influence of St. Boniface had not yet made itself felt in
the Frankish Church, at all events, within the limits of
ancient Gaul.

That St. Boniface gave a strong impulse to liturgical
reform and to the adoption of Roman customs is indu-
bitable. We know little, however, of the details of his
activity in this direction. He must have been vigorously
supported by the PopeS, whose counsellor 116 was, as well
as their legate. There was introduced into the matter,
momover, a zeal and an acrimonious heat far removed
from the spirit manifested in the Gregorian document Ι
have just cited. One of the most impressive rites in the
Gallican Mass was the benediction of the people by
the bishop at the moment of communion. So much
importance was attached to this rite that it was retained
even after the adoption of the Roman Liturgy. Almost
all the Sacramentaries of the Middle Ages contain formu-
laries of benediction; they are even still in use in the
Ohurch of Lyons. I quote here a letter to Boniface from

Pope Zacharias, which shows how the latter speaks of
them.
