192 CHRISTIAN WORsHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

at least not in this place. It is evidently an Eastern im-
portation‚ or rather Byzantine. At the time of the second
Council of Vaison (529), it was used only at “public Masses.'’
This council decreed (c. 3) that it was to be sung at all

Masses without distinction.
In place of the Trisagion we find in the Mozarabic and

Ambrosian Missals the Gloria in excelsis, which is here1 a
Roman importation.

The second chant‚ that of the Kyrie, is preserved in the
Ambrosian Liturgy, but has disappeared from the Mozarabic.
It was customary at Milan, as in Gaul, to restrict the
number of Kyries sung to three. The Kyrie was introduced
in imitation of Eastern usage, but in the Oriental liturgies
it is only employed as the response of the people to the
petitions of the Diaconal Litany‚ and even at Rome it had at
first a strict connection with that litany. In the Gallican
use it was a species of chant absolutely unconnected with
the Litany.

In the time of the Council of Vaison2 the Kyrie was

¹ I say here, for it is certain that the Gloria in excelsis, as a chant in
the 0ffiee, was known in Spain and Northern Italy from the seventh
century at latest (Cone. Tol„ iv. 12; Sacrament. Gall„ p. 780, Muratori),
The Trisagion is mentioned in the life of St. Gery, Bishop of Gambrai
iu the seventh century: “Ay'us, ojus, ojus, per trinum numerum imposuit
in nomine Trinitatis ’⁷ (Αηαῐ. Bon„ vol. vii. p. 393).

² Concil. Vaoense, c. 3: “Et quia tam in sede Apostolica quam etiam
per totas Orientales atque Italiae provincias dulcis et nimium salutaris
consuetudo est intromissa ut Kyrie eleison frequentius cum grandi affectu
et compunctione dicatur: placuit etiam nobis ut in omnibus ecclesiis
nostris ista tam sancta consuetudo et ad matutinum et ad missas et ad
vesperam, Deo propitio intromittatur. Et in omnibus missis, seu in matu-
tinis, seu in quadragesimalibus, seu in illis quae pro defunctorum com-
memoratione fiunt, semper Sanctus9 Sanc-tus, Sanctus, eo ordine quo modo
ad missas publicas dicitur, dici debeat3 quia tam sancta et tam dulcis
et desiderabilis vox, etiamsi die noctuque possit dici, fastidium non possit
generare.” The Sanctus here referred to is evidently the Trisagion‚ and
not the Sanetus after the Preface. Observe that the council does not
name Spain among the countries where it was customary to use the
Kyrie.
