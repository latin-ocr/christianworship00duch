latter countries, where the liturgical language is not Greek,
translations are employed which are made from the Greek
text used in the Patriarchate of Constantinople.

There are now in use two texts of the complete Con-
stantinopolitan Litmgy, besides a Mass of the Presanctified.
The two complete liturgies bear the names of St. Basil and
St. John chrysostom. The first was, at the outset, the
normal Liturgy. It is now used only on the Sundays in
Lent (except Palm Sunday), Holy Thmsday, Easter Eve,
Christmas Eve, the Eve of the Epiphany, and the lst of
January, which is the Feast of St. Basil. On other'days‚
the Liturgy of St. Chrysostom, considerably shorter than
the former, is followed. During Lent‚ except on Saturdays
and Sundays‚ since the Mass, strictly 50 called, 15 not
then celebrated, the Liturgy of the Presanctified 15 used,
which has come to be attributed, but for what reason it
15 not known, to St. Gregory the Great.

The most ancient manuscript known of the Byzantine
Liturgy 15 the Oodeoe Barbermus, No. 77, os the eighth or
ninth century. It is a Eueholoyion‚ which contains, besides
the three liturgies‚ prayers belonging to other services,

Hermanstadt and Tchernowitz, Ronmanian3 in the other countries, Slavonic.
The Uniats of the Byzantine rite are grouped ecclesiastically as follows:
In the Eastern Patriarchates of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria they
are under the Melchite patriarch residing at Damascus, as above-mentioned.
In the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Greek-speaking Uniats have
no special organisation; they are under the Latin bishops, as are also
the few Greek parishes in Italy and Sicily. Those speaking Bulgarian
in Turkey, Roumanian in Hungary, and Ruthenian in Austro-Hungary
and Russia, have bishops and even ecclesiastical provinces of their
own rite.
