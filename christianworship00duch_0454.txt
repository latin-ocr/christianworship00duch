CHAPTER XIV.

THE NUPTIAL BLESSING.

TERTULLIAN 1 extols the happiness of that marriage which
is cemented by the Ghurch, confirmed by the oblation‚
scaled with the benediction, which the angels proclaim,
and which is ratified by the Heavenly F ather. Many other
ancient writers also speak of marriages celebrated before
the Church and blessed by her with more or less solemnity.
No ecclesiastical law, however, obliged Christians to seek
a blessing on their marriage. The benediction was a matter
of custom or propriety, and although it subsequently became
the rule, it was never a condition of validity. The marriage

is independent of the rite.

to the times and countries in which it was celebrated.2

Ordines or from the ancient liturgical books, except the
prayers of the nuptial Mass and those of the nuptia]

customs or ceremonies 111 this or that country, the Counoil of Trent desires

that they should be retained.
