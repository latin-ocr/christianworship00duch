420 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ms omem ΛΝΒ Evomrion.

term “ ascetic‚’⁷ or “ monk '' (α’σκὴτης, μόυαχος), in the fourth
century was more frequently used in Greek-speaking
countries to denote men; whereas in Latin, when these
same terms were not employed, the word “confessor,'' or,
later on, “religious,’' was used (confessor, meliyiosuffl The
women were designated by the name of virqins, or sacred
viryins (πάρθενοι, viryines sacrae).

This term, like the maJ‘ority of those that preceded it,
expressed the kind of renunciation which was most highly
esteemed and sought after. We must be cautious in drawing
comparisons between the modern “ religious'' of both sexes
and their forerunners of a remote antiquity. The earlier
examples cultivated ascetism for its own sake, and not as a
famul-able condition sor meditation‚2 or for the exercise of
works of charity, of preaching‚ and teaching. The Christian
virgin who remained a virgin had performed the essential
part of her supererogatory obligations. No special fervour

true that this idea developed rapidly, and ecclesiastical

¹ Confessor is the term used in the Roman Liturgy; see infra, p. 421,
note 2: an epitaph (De Bessi, Ball„ 1874, pl. vi.) of Tarquinii mentions
a Eum-ius ccmfhssom it is in this sense that the term is employed in
the Couneils of Elvira (c. 25), Arles (314, c. 9), and Toledo (400, oc.
6, 9).

² St. Paul (1 Cor. vi.) adopts a standpoint more in harmony with our
own. It should be noted that what he says with regard to virginity is
in connection with the immediate coming of Christ: tempus breve est,
praeterit fiqura hujus mundi. We should be careful to realise that
Christian asceticism is in no way derived from this teaching of the
apostle. Aseeticism is anterior to Christianity, end is certainly not peculiar

toit.
