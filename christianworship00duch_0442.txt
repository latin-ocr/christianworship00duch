416 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: rrs omem AND EVOLUTION.

deposition of the relics are quite distinct ceremonias,
and took place usually on different days. The bishop
began by sealing the table of the altar, which was
placed either on columns or 011 6 solid base. He made
upon it the sign of the cross, and washed it,
in the first instance, with baptismal water, and then
with wine. He then anointed it with chrism (μώμου),1
and finally fumigated it with incense. When the altar
had been consecrated, he made a circuit of the church,
swinging the censer, while a priest, walking behind him,
anointed, in the form of a cross, the walls, columns, etc.
The ceremony came to an end with the blessing of the
linen, sacred vessels, lamps, and other objects used in
worship.

The depositio, which was preceded by a solemn vigil,
was accomplished wit-h all the ceremony possible.2 On
arrival at the church, the chant Tollite portas, principe&
vestras was sung. Before closing the tomb of the relics
the bishop anointed it with chrism.

This summary is sufficient 130 impress upon us the
relationship existing between the Greek ritual and our
second Latin ritual. After all that we have seen of the
relations between the Byzantine and Gallican LiturgieS,

¹ Dionysius the Areopagite (Ec-cl. Hier., iv. 12) mentions the use of
μύρον 111 1116 consecration of the altar.

² At Constantinople the emperor took part in the procession, walking
on foot behind his state chariot, in which the patriarch was seated holding the
relies on his knees. Theophanius (pp. 217, 227, 228, 238, De Boor) describes
in the same way dedications celebrated at Constantinople in the time of
Justinian, in the nyears 537, 550, 551, 562. Η6 6150 mentions the chant
’Ἄρατε πύλας, οἱ ἄρχοντες, ὑμῶν. An ivory, preserved at Treves, represents
one of these ceremonies, possibly that of St. Irene, at Galata, which was
celebrated in 551. My reason for supposing this date 15 1116 presence of
two patriarchs in the Imperial chariot. Now, Theophanius says that the
dedication of 551 was presided over by the two patriarche Menas of
Constantinople and Apollinaris of Alexandria. See a representation (a.
bad one) of this obJect in the Revuc de Z’Art Chre‘tien, vol. xxxi. p. 122.
