which derived their authority from the three dioceses already
mentioned (can. 28). He was invested, moreover, with a
jurisdiction coextensive with that of the civil rulers of

In this manner the occupants of the sees of Caesarea,

became mere metropolitans, whose only honours consisted in Ἰ
a few titular privileges and in distinctions of precedence.
By the fusion of the three dioceses of Thrace, Asia, and
Pontus, the patriarchate of Constantinople thus became
established.

It was not, however, in this matter alone that the area
of ecclesiastical influence exercised by Antioch had become
restricted. It might be supposed that the diocese of Orient,

But such was not the case. At the very beginning of the
