THE GALLIGAN MAss. 191

The deacon enjoins silence3 for which the Mozarabic
formulary is Silentium facite} The bishop salutes the
congregation in a formulary preserved by St. Germain
and identical with that given in the Mozarabic Liturgy.
At Milan it was the custom to use Dominus vobiscum, as
at Rome. St. Germain speaks of the salutation only in
this place, that is, before the introductory canticles. This
is the place also assigned to the first salutation in the
Ambrosian Liturgy. In the Mozarabic it is said only aster
the collect. In these two liturgies the salutation follows
each of the three lections‚2

GERMAIN: Ajits vero ante prophetiam pro hoe canitur
in yraeca linqua quia. . . . Incipiente praesule ecelesia Ajus
psallit, dicens latinum cnon graeco· . . . Dietmn Anien ex
hebraeo. . . . Tres autem parvuli qui ore uno sequentes Kyrie
eleison. . . . Canticum autem Zachariae pontificis inhonorem
sancti ‘Iohannis Baptistae cantatur . . .; ideo prophetiam
qnam pater ejus ipso nascente eeeinit alternis vocibus eeclesia
psallit.

There are three canticles: first, the Trisagion (Ajus =
Ἄγιος), which was intoned by the bishop‚ at first in Greek,
and afterwards in Latin3 second, the Kyrie eleison, sung by
three boys3 and third, the Benedictus, or “prophecy.'' In
the Mozarabic and Milanese uses the Trisagion is not found,

¹ In the Mozarabic Missal we do not encountcr it at this place.
With regard to the demand for silence, cf. Gregory of Tours, Hist.
Franoe, vii. 8: “Quadam die dominica, postquam diaconus silentium
populis ut missae abscultarentur indixit. . . .'‘ Cf. Isidore, De Eecl.
Ο ciis, i. 10.
ffi² With this difference that in the Mozarabic Liturgy it precedes, and, in
the Ambrosian, follows the response chanted after the first lection.
