182 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: 1Ts ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

invisible altar, before the shrine of the Divine Majesty.
This symbolical transference is in a contrary sense to that
implied in the Greek formulary; it involves not the descent
of the Holy Spirit upon the oblation, but the elevation by
God's angel of the oblation to heaven. But in both cases
alike it is aster it has been brought near to, and has
participated in, the Divine Virtue that it is called the Body
and Blood of Christ.

The prayers which follow correspond with the Great
Intercession of the Greek Liturgies‚ and occupy the same

place as that assigned to it in the Syro—Byzantine 1113.

It is certain that this formulary has been much cur-
tailed. It begins with the commemoration of the faithful
departed (Μ677ι67ιΐο),1 but it embraces also the commemora-
tion of the living and of the saints (Nobis quoquc). There
is an evident hiatus at the end of this prayer after the
words Zarqitor admitte. After mentioning by name 1113 3311113
among whom 1113 supplicants pray 10 be admitted one
day, it goes on: Per Christum Dominum nostrum, per
quem haee omnia, Domine, semper bona creas, sanctificas,
vivificas et praestas nobis. It 13 manifest that the words
haec omnia bona have no connection with those which
precede. They cannot, moreover‚ mean the consecrated
offerings, which are now the Body and Blood of Christ,
and to which the terms 67633, sanctificas, vivificas, cannot
consequently be applied. The easiest explanation of the
difficulty is that there was formerly here a mention of
the fruits of the earth, with an enumeration of the various
kinds—wheat‚ wine, oil, etc. This view 13 confirmed,

¹ The Memento of the departed 13 wanting in several ancient copies of
the Canon, as, for instance, in the Gelasian Sacramentoery. This omission
arose, I believe, from the fact that this formulary served 33 3 framework
for the diptychs of the dead. which were read from 3 special text, 3 1011,

3 1311131, or something of this kind.
