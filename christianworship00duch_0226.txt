interprete 11116 66 applying to the gates of the soul‚ that is,
the 6611666, 10111 1116 11116 signification 16 furnished by the
Liturgy of St. «1611166, when the deacon exclaims: Μή τις
τιῖν κατηχουμένων, μή τις τῶν ἀμυήτων, μή τις τῶν μή
δυναμένων ἡμῖν συνδεηθῆναιὲ Ἀλλήλους ἐπίγνωτεέ Τὰς

doors of the chureh, which had to be guarded 111 order that
no profane person might enter the assembly.

The 0101611011 was prepared beforehand‚ and there was
bestowed on it by anticipation the 661116 honour which it had
after 60116661611011. It was even already designated by the
1611116 Body and Blood of Christ. The preparation took place
before the entrance of the celebrant,l and was performed
with 11166 and prayers‚ of which no traces remain in 1116
Merovingian manuscripts. Some relies of it are to be
found in the Irish books, the Stowe Μ16661, and the Lebhar
Breac.2 The Mozarabic Missal contains the whole ceremony
down to the most minute details. It even repeats it at the
end of the Procession of the Oblation, after having previously
prefixed it to the entry of the celebrant. Its place after the
Procession of the Oblation is 11161 which this rite occupies in
the Ambrosian Μ16661, and it 16 11161 of 116 counterpart, the

Order of St. Dominio.
