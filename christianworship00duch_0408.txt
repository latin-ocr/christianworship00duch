2. The Dalmatio.

Besides these two 3553111131 1735111131115, common to all
the clergy, the Pope and his deacons wore, on festivals,
between the ordinary tunic (linea) and the planeta, a second
tunic with large sleeves, called a dalmatic. This combi-
nation of the three garments was used considerably anterior
to the time when the ecclesiastical costume became stereo-
typed. On the day of his martyrdom (258) St. Cyprian
wore a 1111311 1111110, 3 (1311113110, 311(1 311 over-garment,
answering to the paenula, or planeta.l As early as the
end of the fifth century the dalmatic, which had passed out
of fashion as an ordinary article of clothing, had become
1113 distinguishing badge of the Pope and his clergy.2 The
Pope sometimes granted it 35 311 honorary decoration to
bishops and deacons of other Churches. Pope Symmachus
(cira. 513) conferred 11115 privilege on the deacons of Arles;
St. Gregory made a similar gift (599) to the Bishop of Gap
and his archdeacon.3 The bishops and deacons of Ravenna,

flexit et in orationem se Domino prostravit. Et cum se dalmatica
exspoliasset et diaconibus tradidisset, in linea stetit et coepit speculatorem
sustinere.’'

2 The Lib. Pontis. (vol. i. p. 171, of my edition) attributes the intro-
duction of it to Pope Silvester. The legendary life of St. Sflvester,
written at the end of the fifth century, does not make it go back so far,
but implies that it had been in use for about 3 century. It should be
noted that,' according to the author of this document, the Roman diaconal
tunicle was at the outset the same as the σοῑοῖηιε, which the emperor
Honorius commanded his senators to wear as their outdoor tunic (see supra,

. 379).

M„ Ep.9 ix. 107 (219). St. Gregory was even careful to send dalmatics
ready made to Gap, which shows that they were not usually worn in that
country. We often see quoted a similar concession by Pope Zacharias to
Austrobert‚ Bishop of Vienne; but the document which contains it is an

apocryphal 'letter (J affe, 2258).
