THE CHRISTIAN FESTIVALS. 243

the fast, but later on uses the terms “the fast of Lent
and the Holy Week of Easter.'’ At Rome it was the
custom to observe the fast for only the last three weeks
before Ε66161.1

Varions endeavours were made in various countries
to combine the Quadragesima with the Holy Week. At
Antioch and in the Churches following this great centre,
the two periods were more distinctly defined than else-
where. In one of his 11016111662 81. Chrysostom expresses
himself somewhat as follows: “We have at length come
to the end of Quadragesima, and we are now about to
enter on the great week.” In the Apostolio 0072-
stitutions also3 it is formally declared that the fast of
Lent is finished when that of the great paschal week
is begun. At Rome, on the other hand, and at Alexandria,
and even at Jerusalem} Holy WVeek was included in
the Quadragesima in such a manner that the whole fast
lasted only six weeks, but at Constantinople and in the
East properly so called, that 16, 1116 6011611166 following
the ancient custom of Antiooh, the fast was observed for

seven weeks. The Sundays only were excepted at Rome,

the exception of Saturday in Holy wear, were exempt

¹ Socrates, H. E„ v. 22. This passage, however, inspires me with some
distrust, for it says that in these three weeks the Sundays and Saturdays
were excepted. The exception of the Saturdays 16 far from being con-
formable 10 Roman usage. I am inclined to believe that the three weeks
of fasting, following the primitive custom of Rome, were 1101 continuous,
but broken by intervals, that is, the fast was observed on the first, the
fourth, and the sixth week. The first is now assigned to the spring
Ember Days, the fourth, called formerly mediana, 1166 preserved certain
liturgieal peculiarities‚ and the sixth 16 Holy Week. These three weeks

are weeks for ordination.

⁴ As 10 Jerusalem, there were fluctuations, for the Pereqrinatio of Etheria
(silvia) speaks of a Lent of eight weeks’ duration (cf. infra, pp. 499, 554).
