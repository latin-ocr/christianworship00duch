176 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN' AND EVOLUTION.

Orate, fratres, ut meam ao vestrum sacrificium acceptabile fiat
apud Deum Patrem omnipotentem. The form of prayer
which follows and which at the beginning was merely the
conclusion of the prayer offered up in silence by the faithful,
was said in a low voice, and hence its name of Secreta. It
was terminated by an eephony, that is, by an ending on a
high note, to which Amen was responded.

At this point came the eucharistie prayer which
corresponded to the Amphora of the Greek liturgies.¹
It was divided by the chanting of the Sanctus into two
parts of unequal length, of which the first, sung on
a high note, was called the Po’eface, and the second,
recited in a low tone, named the Canon. The Roman
Anaphora possesses testimony to its great antiquity. The
form at present in use existed already, word for word, at
the beginning of the seventh century. St. Gregory gave
to it its final touch, adding to the prayer Hanc iyitar
the following words: diesque nostros in tua pace disponas?
atque ab eterna damnatione nos eripi et in electorum
tuorum jubeas glreyo numerari. The author of the Liber
Pontz'fica-Zz's, which dates from the beginning of the sixth

(440-461) had added some words 10 it.3 But we can go

in the Roman use, of the liturgy of the Mass. It is met with in all the
solemn benedictione and consecrations.

incessant troubles brought about by the Lombardic invasion. Cf. Liber
Ροηύίχὶ, vol. i. p. 312.

³ The words are sanctum sacrzfi'oz'um, immaculatam hostiam, which
stand in apposition to the mention of Melchisedec’s sacrifice in the prayer
Supra quae propitio. I think that St. Leo must have intended to in-
troduce by them a protest against the Manicheans who did not allow the
use of wine in their liturgy. Cf. Lib. Pontis„ vol. i. p. 239.
