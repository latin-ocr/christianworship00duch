BOOKS or THE LATIN RITE. 159

In the part] before 13116 Preface, 13116 prayers are mostly
arranged according to the Gallican use, and placed under
Gallican rubrics; in nearly one-third 01 ‘che Masses, how-
ever, the prayers are preceded by Roman rubrics, and are
arranged according to 13116 Roman mebhod. The compiler‚
neverbheless> has shown such a wan‘n 01 311111, 131161 10 'ohe
Masses 01 Roman type 13116 prayers are mostly Gallican, and
vice versa. He even places purely Gallican invibatories
under 13116 rubrics belonging 130 Roman prayers. In shorb,
all we have in 131113 text is a very bad attempt 130 combine

13116 two 11363.1
Mabillon is 01 opinion that, bhe Bobbio Missal may have

come from ‘ohe province of Besancon‚ wherein was situated
Luxeuil, which was the 010131161 1101136 01 13116 Italian
Convent. He regards 13116 Μ633 01 St. Sigismund as being
an 1011106131οο 10 favour 01 this conjecture. Ι am unable
130 say whether 131113 13 30 or 0013. The Mass 01 St. Sigismund
is 001 6 Mass for 'che anniversary 01 this saint, 111113 006
for ‘che cure 01 the sever-stricken, 01 whom he was regarded
63 ‘ohe patron, and ‘chat 0013 only in the Seine valley and
Burgundy, 101113 10 other districts. I should rather be
inclined bo lay stress on 13116 place from whence 13116 016011-
script came, and on 13116 sach that the name 01 St. Ambrose
occurs in the Canon of the Mass, a peculiarity 0013 met] wit-‚h
in any other Gallican or Frankish Sacramentary. The
Roman rite, moreover‚ 13 here combined with the Gallican in
a peculiar 16311100, quite different from that which obtains in
13116 3573136103 01 0010010611οο which we find in 13116 Frankish
manuscripts of 16136 Merovingian times. It 13 nob exacnly
the Ambrosian Liturgy, but it 13 somewha‘n analogous to 113.

One of them, Dom Cagin, 1163 explained 1113 theory in the Pale‘oqrccphie
Musicale, vol. v. p. 97, et scq.; but I cannot share his opinions. I have
given my reasons in the Reme &Histoire et de Lata-acme Reliqieuses‚ vol. v.
