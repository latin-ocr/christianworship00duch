'an DIVINE OFFICE. 453

It will be easily understood that, When confronted with
so vast a subject, I have been obliged to abstain from

entering upon it in detail, and ean touch upon in only
superficially}

In ihese eountries, we must take note of an indigenous development, whioh
took its rise under the direct influenoe of the Oriental uses, and which
owed little to that of the Roman monasteries.

¹ Among the books in which parts of this subject have been treated of
late, I may mention Histoire du Breviczire Romaiu, by Mgr„ Battifol, and the
Geso-hicme des Remis-ohan Breviers, by the lamented Dom Suitbert Baeumer.
