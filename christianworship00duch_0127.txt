of the Litany was assigned to a deacon. At Rome this
office, together with other analogous functions, was trans-
ferred at a somewhat early date from the deacon to the
precentor.

The second form of prayer was arranged as follows. The
president of the congregation, that is, the officiating minister,

in this position for some time, praying silently. Then the
voice of the officiating minister was heard, expressing in
a short formulary a resume', as it were, of the prayers
arising from every beart, and the congregation associated
themselves with him by the response Amen.

We find, it is true, no description anywhere of this ritual.
The liturgical books which have come down to us are neither
sufficiently ancient nor explicit enough to furnish us with
information on the point. The structure of the formularies
contained in them is such, however, that we cannot imagine
matters to have been otherwise conducted at the outset.

In the Gallican ritual‚ in fact, the principal prayers are
always preceded by an invitatory, in which the officiating

composed for a similar purpose. A real formulary of prayer
follows, in which the officiating minister addresses his sup-
plications to God in the name of all present. The following
