Gaul, and in Spain,1 allowing for certain differences in
the number of days and in the time fixed for the beginning

of the fast.
The summer Ember days at Rome offered some points

of resemblance to the Pentecostal fast.

In Gallican regions the fast of the kalends of January
was also observed. It is to this, possibly, that Philastrius‚
writing in the fourth century, refers when he speaks of the
fast of the Epiphany? The aim of this observance in Gaul
and Spain3 was to detach the faithful from the pagan
masquerades and ceremonies of the 1st of January—ancient
heathen customs‚ of which traces remain until the present
day. It is possible, however, that this custom was adopted
at the very beginning as a preparation for the observance
of the Epiphany.4 From the example of the fast which
precedes Easter, it was concluded that every high festival
ought to have a preparatory fast immediately before it.
Such was 1116 origin of the fast before Christmas, which is
mentioned by Philastrius in the passage just referred 10, and
which was adopted later on in Graul.5 This was the fast

c. 17 (in reference to monks only). In the East it was not begun until
after the octave of Pentecost. This was the fast which, having been
extended up to the festival of SS. Peter and Paul (June 29), became the
Greek fast of the Holy Apostles,

⁴¹ We have previously seen (p. 260) that the festival of the Epiphany
seems to have been regarded, in Gallican countries, as of more importance
than 11161 of Christmas.

observed by monks (Bede, Η. E, iii. 27; iv. 30). It is worthy of note that
in the system referred 10 by Philastrius there were, 66 61 Rome, four
solemn fasts every year : those of Lent, Pentecost, Ohristmas, and Epiphany;
but the appointment of the special weeks and months did not originate
from one and the same consideratione.
