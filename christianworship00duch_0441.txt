THE DEDICATION OF GHUROHES. 415

(No. lxxxviii.) and the Missale Francorum, and, in the
second, that the latter document does not begin the series
of prayers assigned to the officiating minister until the
Creator et Conservator, whose frequent repetitions are in
the Gallican style; and thirdly, that it omits altogether
the two consecrating prayers, Deus qui loca and Deus sanc-
tz'ficationum. We have reason, therefore, to believe that
these prayers were foreign to the original Gallican ritual.
The elimination of them, however, does not in any way
affect the character of the ceremony. The principa]
prayer, Deus omnipotens, in cujus honorem, is transferred,
it is true, to the end, but this serves to give only more
unity to the ritual, for in place of two consecrating
prayers we have only one.

As for the remaining portion, we find it touched upon
-lighffly, it is true—in a passage of Gregory of Tours‚l
where the dedication of an oratory in honour of St. Allyre
(Illidius) is dealt with. Gregory himself presided at the
ceremony in his cathedral town. On the previous night
the relies had been “watched'’ in the basilica of St.
Martin. The bishop proceeded in the morning to the
oratory‚ where he consecrated the altar.2 He then returned
to the basilica, and, having taken the relics, translated
them in procession to the oratory. The ceremonies
assume here the same order as those in our second
ritual. At Rome the ceremony would have begun by
the fetching of the relics from the basilica where they
had been provisionally placed.

A most remarkable coincidence is found between
the ceremony described and the Byzantine ritual pub-
h'shed by Goar.3 In this ritual the dedication and the
