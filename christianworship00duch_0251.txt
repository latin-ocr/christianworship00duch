THE GHRISTIAN FEsTIVALs. 229

name of 8111110113, without indicating the days 3 this omission
is, however, supplied by Clement of Alexandria,l Ter-
tullian,2 and a number of later writers. The fasts of
the Stations were not prolonged fasts‚ as they did not
extend beyond the ninth hour‚ that is, until the middle
·os the asternoon.

From the point of view of worship in its strict
sense, the services on these holy days were not all alike.
Sunday was essentially the day for liturgica] worship in
common. The liturgical service took place in the early
hours of the morning3 but this service was preceded by
another, held before daybreak‚ which consisted of lec·
tions‚ homilies, the singing of chants, and the recital of
prayers. This nocturnal meeting, or vigyz'l, is mentioned at
an early date, namely, 111 the letter in which Pliny speaks of
the customs of the Christians.3 This service was com-
bined later on with the office of Matius, which gradually
superseded it. The two services were still distinct, al-
though mentioned together, in the description of the ritual
at Jerusalem given in 1116 Peregrrimctz'o Eclmiae (Silviae). At
Rome the Vigil was retained for certain solemn seasons, such

as Easter, Whitsuntide, the Sundays of the Ember Days.
The offices for Easter Eve and Whitsun Eve, in that part

which precedes the benediction of the baptismal water,
still preserves the type of the ancient vigils as they
were celebrated every Sunday in the first centuries of
Christianity.4

³ Rex„ 96: “Adfirmabant . . . quod essent soliti stato die ante lucem
convenire, carmenque Christo quasi deo dicere secum invicem . . . ; quibus
peractis morem sibi discedendi fuisse, rursusque coeundi ad capiendum
cibum, promiscuum tamen et innoxium.'’

⁴ The same may bc remarked of the sequence of lections, responses, and
- prayers with which the Mass for Saturday in the Ember Days begins.
This Mass is, in reality, the early Mass of the following day, Sunday.
