OEcumenical Council 01 381, bears witness, nevertheless,
to the use of the 01101011 at Constantinople in the fifth
century, divides the heretica] sects into two categorias,
those whose baptism, but not confirmation, was accepted,
and those whose baptism and confirmation were both re-
jected.1 The Monophysites, who separated from the Church
in the fifth and sixth centuries‚ were treated with less
severity, and were admitted upon a mere profession 01 1116

The Western 01101011 remained faithful to the old
Roman custom, which was 011611 enjoined by the Popes.
CounciIS, accounts of conversions of heretics, and even

constantly found in the texts when the rite of imparting the Holy Spirit
is in question, depending on whether it is regarded as occurring in the
celebration of an ordinary baptism, or in connection with the reconciliation
of heretics. Sometimes it is unction, or the chrismatio, that is spoken of,
at other times the laying-on of hands. But we have only to compare the
texts to see that the one hardly ever goes without the other. As a rule, the
Roman texts employ the term consignatio when it is a question of ordinary
confirmation, and that of manus impositio for the reconciliation 01 116161105.
It is even possible that, in countries where the Roman rite was followed,
the whole ceremony was not repeated for converted heretios. Certain
passages of St, Optatus and St. Augustine give colour to this, and the
same may be said of the text of St. Gregory the Grreat (Ep, xi. 67 (52):
*Arianos per impositionem manus Occidens, per unctionem vero saneti,
