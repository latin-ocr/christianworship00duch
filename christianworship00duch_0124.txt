104 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: 1Ts ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

There was no order anywhere‚ nothing but the most
complete anarchy—a lawless state of affairs which would
have been irremediable if the Carlovingian monarchs had
made no appeal to tradition and to the authority of the
Roman Church.1

The intervention of Rome in the reformation of the
liturgy was neither spontaneous nor very active. The
Popes contented themselves with sending copies of their
liturgic-al books without troubling themselves as to the
use which might be made of them. The individuals who
were charged by the Frankish kings—-Pepin, Charlemagne,
and Louis the Picus—with the execution of the liturgical
reform did not regard themselves as prohibited from
supplementing the Roman books or from combining with
them whatever seemed worth preserving in the Gallican
rite. Hence arose a somewhat composite liturgy, which
from its source in the Imperial chapel spread throughout
all the Churches of the Frankish Empire‚ and at length,
finding its way to Rome, gradually supplanted there the
ancient use. The Roman Liturgy, from the eleventh century
at the least, is nothing else than the Frankish Liturgy‚
such as men like Alcuin, Helisachar‚ and Amalarius had
made it. lt is even extraordinary that the ancient
Roman books—representing the genuine use of Rome up
to the ninth century—have been so completely displaced
by others, that not a single example of them is now to
be found.

It would appear that the liturgical reform taken in

¹ It was owing to this state of things, and not to ethnographical considera-
tions (see The Prayer Book of Aedelwald the Bishop, commonly called the
“Book of Cerne‚’' notes, p. 3), that such diversity of uses as are found in our
ancient Merovingian books is explained. If the Roman books present a
greater uniffirmity, it is because they come from one and the sels-same
Ohurch‚ and not from various Churches liturgically independent of each
other. Why should it surprise us, moreover, that the Gregorian books
resemble one another ⁴? They were all derived from one copy.
