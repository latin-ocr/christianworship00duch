LITURGICAL FORMULARIES AND Booxs. 113

but even in the same country, these varieties depending
on whether the Ohurch was an important one, capable of
indulging in the expense of a rich liturgica] library, or
whether it was a poor country Church which had to
restrict itseli‘ to what was absolutely necessary. Setting
aside the Lectionary of Luxeuil‚ of which I will treat
further on, Ι am unable to furnish instances of the
existence in the West of this kind of book before the
time of Charlemagne. Those of the East are not more
ancient. But there is no doubt that the majority of the
very ancient manuscripts of the Bible, whether Greek or
Latin, which have come down to us, were employed for
public reading in Ohurches. They still bear traces of
this use.

ᾗ 3.-ΤΗΕ CHANTs.

The chanting of the psalms was from the beginning,
as I have previously pointed out, one of the essential
elements of public worship. Its use alternated with the
lections, which were read either at the office for vigils, or at
Mass before the oblation.

In ancient times, and up to the latter part of the fourth
century, the psalms were always sung as a solo, and,
doubtless‚ also with somewhat complicated modulations.
The congregation, however, repeated the last words of the
chant. The execution of the liturgical chant is described
in this way in the Apostolie Constantium} The choir-
rules, morecver, prescribe this same mode of chanting in
the case of those portions which, in the Roman use, corre-
spond to the most ancient psalmody-I mean the gradual
and the other musical pieces inserted between the Epistle
and Gospel. These psalms are essentially Psalmi responsorii
