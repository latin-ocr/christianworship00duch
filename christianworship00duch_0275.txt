THE OHRISTIAN FESTIVALs. 253

great festival, then adopting the tone and style of
the most solemn prayer—the Eucharistic—he called for
the Divine blessing on that luminous pillar which was
about to shed its radiance on the mysteries of the Christian
Passover, as in like manner of old the pillar of fire had
gone before the children of Israel to guide them in their
wanderings in the desert. He dwelt poetically upon the
elements composing it, the papyrus,l which furnished the
wick, and the virgin 011 and the beeswax, which formed
the material. Here occurred a curicus eulogy of the bee,
chaste and secund like the Virgin mother, and which in
the manner of its generation furnished a type of the eternal
origin of the Divine Word.2

The following is the formulary now in use. Ι re-
produce it here from the earliest manuscripts? without
taking into consideration later revisions.

¹ See the two blessings of the candle, contained in the opuscula of
Ennodius, Nos. 9 and 10.

² The following is the passage 111 13116 formulary Deus mundi conditor
of the Gelasian Sacramentary: “Apes vero sunt frugales in sumptibus,
in procreatione castissimam aedificant cellulas cereo liquore fundatas,
quarum humanae peritiae ars magistra non coaequat. Legunt pedibus
flores et nullum damnum in floribus invenitur. Partus non edunt, sed ore
legentes concepti foetus reddunt examina, sicut exemplo mirabili Christus
ore paterno processit. Fecunda est in his sine partu virginitas, quam
utique Dominus sequi dignatus carnalem se matrem habere virginitatis
amore constituit. Talia igitur, Domine, digna sacris altaribus tuis munera
offeruntur, quibus te laetari religio christiana non ambigit.'' The general
subject of the Praeconium Paschaze is described, and somewhat caricatured,
in a letter attributed to St. Jerome, but certainly of the year 384 (Migne,
Pat. Lat.9 vol. xxx. p. 182). This is addressed to a deacon of Placenza,
called Praesidius, who had asked the writer to draw up for him his
Praeconium.

³ This is the sormulary which appears in the three Gallican Sacra-
mentaries‚ from whence it passed into the supplement to the Sacramentary
of Adrian, which was probably compiled by Alcuin (see above, p. 121),
This supplement contains also the formulary Deus mundi conditor, peculiar-
to the Gelasian Sacramentary. Ennodius (Optem, 9, 10) has left us two
formularies of this kind, drawn up, doubtless, for his own use, whilst he
was Deacon of the Church of Pavia.
