7. The Festivals of the Apostles.

I have already mentioned certain festivals of the
apostles celebrated at Christmastide. Ι proceed now
to deal with some other festivals of the same nature,
confining myself to the notice of those which were
celebrated at an early date in the West. The most
important of these is that of St. Peter and St. Paul, on
the 29th of June. It appears in the Philocalian Calendar
of the year 336, coupled with the consular date 258„
I have elsewhere1 shown how this date may serve to
determine the origin of the festival. We have here, not
the anniversary of the martyrdom of either of the apostles‚
or of them both together, but merely the commemoration
of the translation of their relics to the place called
ad Cataozombas, at the third milestone on the Appian
Way. At the beginning of the fourth century, when the
calendar of the Roman Ohurch was drawn up, from which
calendar the text of the Philocalian is derived, the bodies
of the two apostles were still reposing in this place.
They were removed from it later on to be deposited in
the basilicas raised to their honour by the Emperor Con-
stantine on their original burying-places at the Vatican
and the Ostian Way respectively. These translations brought
about no change in the date of the celebration of their
festival, the observation which had doubtless become rooted
in the customs of the Christian population in Rome.

The same calendar contains, under the date of the 22nd
of February, a festival entitled Nazala Petro: dc cathedra.
It was intended to be a commemoration of the beginning
of the episcopate or apostolate of St. Peter. Its con-
nection with the festival of the 29th of June was exactly
the same as that Which exists between the anniversaries
