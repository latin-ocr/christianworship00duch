THE MAss IN THE EAsr. 49

However frequently these Divine phenomena might occur,
they were not on that account the less extraordinary, and
it is impossible to regard them, properly speaking, as a
religious institution. Neither the Christian communities
nor their pastors were able to produce them or to obtain
them at will. It was very difficult even to regulate them,
as we see from the history of St. Paul and the Church at
Corinth. Moreover, they soon disappeared‚ and from the
beginning of the second century onwards we find only
exceptional and isolated instances of them. The only per-
manent element, on the whole, which Christianity added to
the liturgy of the synagogue was thus the sacred meal
instituted by J esus Christ as a perpetual commemoration of
Himself.

The details of this august ceremony are furnished by
the synoptic Gospels, and by the passage in which St. Paul
treats of the Last Supper. We have, first of all, the act of
thanksgiving, or eucharistic prayer, then the breaking of
the bread‚ and finally the distribution of the bread and
wine to those present. These constitute, strictly speaking,
the principal elements of the Mass in its entirely Christian
and original aspect.

It is not my aim to adduce here all the texts of the
second or third century in Which there is mention made of
the Eucharist and of its essential rites. I confine myself
to quoting from the most important of them, namely, the
description of the Christian meetings for worship on Sunday,
which we find in the first Apoloyy of Justin Martyr}

¹ Justin, Apol.⁹ i. 6. At its very origin, as we see in the First Epistle to
the Corinthiam, the Eucharistic celebration was preceded by an ordinary
repast partaken of in common. This was what is called the Agape. But
this oustom allowed of the introduction of too many inconveniences to be
lasting. The liturgica] Agape disappeared, 01· nearly so, within less than
a hundred years after the first preaching of the Gospel. As for the love-
feast (Teriaullian, Apol„ 39), it continued to take place, and survived, especially
on the occasion of a funeral, down to at least the fifth century.
