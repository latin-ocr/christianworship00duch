of the psalms, antiphons and responds‚ in the prayers,
litanies or “collecta'' even in the lections, and the hours
of saying the offices and the times of the year to be observed.
In these, as in the primitive services for Sundays and
the stations‚ the suffragan churches followed the usage
of the great metropolitan cathedrals. Provincial councils
did their best to regulate the details and obtain some sort
of uniformity. On the other hand, the order of the offices
constituted one of the principal features of the monastic
rules. The important religious houses‘ followed on this
point the rules which they had adopted3 others accepted
the diocesan or provincial usage, as laid down by the
bishops. In the West, down to the ninth century, there
existed no uniformity in this sphere. When at length
uniformity was arrived at, it was due to the influence of the
Benedictine mle, and specially 1 to that of the great Roman
monasteries which had sprung up around the basilicas
of the Lateran‚ the Vatican, and Santa Maria Maggiore.
These eventually became Chapters, first of regular, then
of secular monks‚ hut they represented in the main
the principium et fons of the whole Latin development of
ecclesiastical and monastic offices.'2

¹ 1 shall confine myself 10 pointing ont a few facts which may be of
interest to those who study the ancient office books. At Rome, at all
events down to the ninth century, hymns were unknown; chante, psalms,
and other Scriptural canticles alone being used. The lectione, at first
reserved for the ancient services of the Vigil and the Mass, were not
introduced into the offices until some time had elapsed‚ zze. about the
seventh century. The offices, therefore, were entirely composed of psalms,
antiphone and responde, and prayers. This primitive Roman usage agrees
exsistly with what was observed at Jerusalem in the time of Etheria (Silvia).
The rule of st. Benedict‚ 011 the other hand, admits of hymns and lectione. See
the letter of Theodemar, Abbot of Monte Cassino, to Charlemagne, in Jaffe
Menum. Gai-olima, p. 360; cf. Lib. Pont„ vol. i. p. 231. note 1, where I have
made the mistake of placing the responds of the offices in the category of
later additions.

'² This applies. of course. to times posterior to the seventh century
in the case of Gaul, and to the tenth and eleventh in the case of Spain.
