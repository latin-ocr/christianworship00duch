444 onmsriAN WORSHIP: irs ORIGm AND EVOLUTION.

The ceremony of the Indulgence is easily separated from
the other parts of the service. It comprises three acts:
the prayer of the penitents themselves, the intercession
of the congregation in their favour, the prayer addressed
in his own person by the bishop to the Divine mercy. The
liturgica] books do not distinguish clearly between the
penitents and the general body of the congregation. At
the opening of the service every one1 appears to be in
the position of a penitent3 but, later on, in that of an
intercessor. But the parts must be distinguished if we
wish to trace back this ritual to its primitive meaning.
In early times the penitent could not re-enter the oom-
munity of the faithful without their expressed consent.
When it was not spontaneously manifested, it was the office
of the bishop to evoke it. The scene is described in a
passage of Tertullian2 narrating the procedure of Pope
Callixtus at the reconciliation of a repentant sinner—

“Thou dost usher into the church the penitent adulterer,
who comes to petition the assembly of the faithful. Behold
him, clad in a hair-shirt, covered with ashes, in garments
of mourning such as to excite horror. He prostrates him-
self in the midst of the congregation, before the widows,
before the priests. He lays hold on the hem of their
garments, he kisses their footprints, he clasps them by the
knees. Meanwhile, thou dost address the people, thou dost
excite public pity for the sad lot of the suppliant. Good
shepherd, blessed Pope, thou dost relate the parable of the
lost sheep, that they may bring thee back thy wandering
she-goat,3 thou dost promise that it shall no more escape
from the flock,'' etc.

¹ Compare this with what has been stated on p. 438, note 2. as 1ο the
origin os the ceremony of the Ashes.

² De Pudicitia, 13.

³ We must not forget that this description is a caricature. Tertullian,
who was a bitter opponent of Pope Callixtus and his deoree concerning
penitense, is here doing his best to turn it into ridicule.
