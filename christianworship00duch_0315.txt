THE CHRISTIAN FESTIVALs. 291

cially those of great cities like Rome, Carthage, Alexandria,
Antioch, and Nicomedia, the so—called martyrologies were
formed. The most ancient collections of this nature seem
to have been drawn up about the middle of the fourth
century, in Africa and Asia Minor respectively. They have
not come down to us in their primitive form. We know
them only as they appear in the Hieronymian Martyrology‚
which was compiled about the middle of the fifth century
in Italy, and thence carried to Franoe, where, about the year
595, it was subjected, at Auxerre, to a revision, from which
revises] text all existing manuscripts of it are derived. In
addition to the Hieronymian Martyrology, there has been
preserved to us the primitive martyrology of Asia Minor
111 a much abridged Syriae translation.l

The Hieronymian Martyrology had attained, from the
seventh to the ninth century, a widespread celebrity3 but,
owing to its complexity, and the many errors made by
copyists, who were embarrassed by the multitude of proper
names both of persons and places, it was held in less esteem
than abridged texts, which, while containing fewer saints,
furnished certain historical details concerning them, together
with extracts from their acts. These are what is known as
historica] martyrologies. The most ancient and best known
examples are those of Bede, Rabanus Maurus, Ado, and
Usuard. The latter, which was drawn up at St. Germain
des Pres about the year 875, enjoyed much popularity during
the Middle Ages. The existing Roman Martyrology is
nothing more than a new edition of the latter, revised and
completed by Cardinal Baronius.

¹ In regard to all this, see the edition of the Hieronymian Martyrology,
which Ι published in 1894 in concert with M. de Rossi, in vol. ii. of the

Acta Sanctorum Novembris.
