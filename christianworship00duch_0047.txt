insular bishops. Their cause was all but lost when the
tomb of St. Barnabas, the apostle of the country, was
suddenly discovered near Salamis. This event, which was
regarded as an intervention of Providence, brought about
a reaction.1 The ecclesiastica} province of Cyprus had its
autonomy confirmed, and has remained in possession of
it to this day.2

Again‚ it was at the Council of Ephesus that the first
official attempt was made to create a patriarchate at Jeru-
salem. The Council of Nicaea had granted the Bishop of
Jerusalem some special honours3 but, far from raising him
to the position of an arch-metropolitan, the Council had
still left him under the jurisdiction of his provincial metro-
politan, the Bishop of Caesarea. A century later, we find the
ambitious and somewhat unscrupulous Juvenal, Bishop of
Jerusalem, exalting the honorary distinctions granted to his
see into a power of jurisdiction, and encroaching boldly on
the domain of 1116 Ρ611161611 of Antioch. At 1116 Council of
Ephesus he endeavoured 10 get his action legalised, and
persistently claimed half of 1116 Syrian provinces, viZ. the
three Palestines (Caesarea, Scythopolis, Petra), together with
the Phoenicia of the Lebanon (Damascus), and Arabia (Bostra).
His pretensions were not allowed. Twenty years later, how-
ever, at the Council of Chalcedon, he returned to the charge.
He entered into an arrangement with the Patriarch of
Antioch, by which the three provinces of Palestine were
made over 10 him. St. Leo, the Pope, though much displeased
at the transaction, did not, however, formally annul it, and
from thenceforward the arrangement has remainedunchanged.3

² It is possible that this autonomy existed from earliest times. The
Council of Ephesus based its recognition of it on an ancient and well-
attested tradition.
