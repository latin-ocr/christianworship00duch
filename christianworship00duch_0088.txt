that it was already consecrated by long use at the time
when these communities took their rise—that is to say,
about the middle of the sixth century. St. J 6101116
appears to have known it. It is certain, at least, that
116 01166 6 liturgical passage that is found in the Liturgy
of St. James1 The manuscripts in Which it is preserved
cannot, unfortunately, lay claim to any antiquity. As it
appears in these manuscripts, it contains many modifications

traceable to the Byzantine 1166.2

2. The Syriae Litu‘rgygs of St. ‹sames—This is nearly
identical with the preceding, from the Kiss of Peace
onwards. The manuscripts Which contain it are of the

eighth century.3

3. The Other Syriae Litmyiea—They differ from one
another only in 13116 Amphora. The Ordinary4 is the same
in all of them.

To 111666 manuscripts must be added a letter of James
of Edessa (end of 1116 seventh century), which contains

² Adv. Pclay„ ii. 23: “Sacer-dotum quotidie ora concelebrant ὁ μόνος
ἀναμάρτητος, quod in lingua nostra dicitur qui solus est sine pcccato.'’ These
words occur also in 1116 Memento for the dead (Brightman‚ p. 57): αὐτὸς
’γάρ ἐστιν ὁ μόνος ἀναμάρτητος φανεὶς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. ΙΙ1 Syriae: “Nec ullus
est a peccati culpa immunis aut a sordibus purus ex hominibus qui super
terram sunt, nisi unus D. N. J esus Christus.''

² The last edition is that of Brightman, Litmyies Ecastern and Westem,
p. 31. The most ancient manuscript is 6 roll of the end of the tenth
century, now preserved at Messina; I must further cite the Rossano manu-
script (Vatia, 1970) of the twelfth century; the Parisinus 2509, of the
fourteenth century (copy No. 303 of the Greek supplement), and the
Parisinus, Greek suppl. 476, also of the fourteenth century. These copies,
or their originals, all come from Syria. The same may be said of the
Sinaitic manuscriptos the fourteenth century, from which Mr. Brightman
1166 taken a diaconicon (the deacon's part) belonging to the Mass of the
Presanctified according to the rite of St. J ames (op. cit.⁷ p. 494).

⁸ Renaudot’s translation (Litury. Orient„ vol. ii.) has been reproduced
by Hammond, 61111, 111 the portione common to the Greek and the Syriae,
by Swainson (The Greek Liturqies: London, 1884). Mr. Brightman gives
the text of this liturgy in English.
