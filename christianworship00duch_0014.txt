x AUTHOR’S PREFAGE.

without being suspected of harbouring a secret ani-
mosity against Pepin d'Heristal and Hugh Capet.
Neither was my main object that of edification.
This book is by no means one to take to church to
help the faithful to follow ceremonia] worship more
intelligently. There is a work which has been written
for this purpose, and which is admirably suited to it—
I allude to the Anne‘e Licuo'gyique of Dom Grueranger.
If, however, my volume is merely a text-book, I do
not think that its perusa] can tend to lessen in the
reader, whoever he may be, that reverence and
affectionate devotion which the venerable rites of
our ancient mother the Catholic Church are entitled
to command. If any expression has escaped me
which might be construed otherwise, Ι should deeply
regret it. These ancient rites are doubly sacred, for
they come to us from God through Christ and the
Church. But they would not possess in 0111· eyes such
a halo of glory about them had they not also been sanc-
15111οἀ by the piety of countless generations. Through-
out how many centuries have the faithful prayed
in these words! What emotions, What joys, what
affoetions, what tearS, have found their expression in
these books, these rites‚ and these prayers 1 I count
myself happy indeed to have laboured in shedding
fresh light upon an antiquity thus hallowed‚ and]
gladly repeat with the owocorus of Euripides-—
Κλεινός δ’ὁ πόνος μοι
θεοῖο-ιν δούλαν χέρ’ ἔχειν,
ου’ θνατοῖς ἀλλ’ ἀθανάτοις·

εὗφάμοις δὲ πόνοις μοχθεῖν
οὐκ ἀποκάμνω. Ion. 134.
