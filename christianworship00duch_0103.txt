THE MAss IN THE EAsr. 83

which the modificatione have been most marked are as

follows :—
In the first place, the entry of the celebrants has become

an imposing ceremony. In the Byzantine Liturgy it was
accompanied from an early date by a special chant, the
Movoyevn'gff Before the lections comes the Trisagion.2 The
use of this doxology must be very ancient. It is common
to all the Greek Oriental liturgias, and occurs even in the
Gallican Liturgy.3 The most ancient testimony for its
existence is found in the Council of Chalcedon (451).4

The dismissal of the catechumene, energumens, com-
petentS, and penitents, which stands out so prominently in
the liturgy of the fourth century, had all disappeared at
an early date, owing to changes in the discipline regarding
these different categories. The Constantinopolitan ritual,
however, has preserved to our own day the ceremony of the
dismissal of the catechumens.

But it was especially in the preparation of the elements
of the sacred feast that 6 theme was found for the develop-
ment of rites and prayers. The bread and wine for conse-
cration were prepared, before the entry of the celebrants, at
a special table—the table of proposition (πρόθεσις)-ε1611(11113
like the altar within the sacred enclosure and out of sight of
the congregation. This constituted a preparatory Mass, the
Mass of the Prothesis, which was very long and complicated,

³ In the Coptic Liturgy the Trisagion is placed before the GospeL and
after the other lections. In the Gallican Liturgy we find it also placed
before 1116 Grospel, and even after it; but this does not interfere with its
being sung at its normal place before the lections.
