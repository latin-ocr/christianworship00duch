2. The Apostolic Constitutions (II. 57 and VIII. 5-15).

3. The Homilies of St. John Chrysostom.

St. John Chrysostom cites frequently in his Homilies
passages, and even prayers, taken from the Liturgy.
Bingham1 was the first to form the project of collecting
and putting into order these scattered data. This work
has been lately undertaken again by several experts.2
Interesting testimony may be drawn from this source, but
the orator nowhere gives a systematic description of the
Liturgy in the order of its rites and prayers.

The Catechism of St. Cyril is really an exposition of the
ceremonies of the Mass, drawn up for neophytes after their
initiation. The preacher leaves out of consideration the
Mass of the Catechumens with which his auditors have
been for a long time famfliar. He assumes that the bread
and wine have been brought to the altar, and begins at

similar works, the Didascalm of tlte Apostles, of which we

Probst makes a distinction between the Homilies preached at Antioch and
those delivered at Constantinople. Mr. Brightman (lib. αϊ, p· 470) has
rehandled the subject, profiting by the labours of his predecessore.
