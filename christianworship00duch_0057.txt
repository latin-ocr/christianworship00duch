they appealed to Rome, or even 111 preference to Rome, had
certainly no intention of creating an opposition between
these two great authorities, or even of placing the Imperial

Ghurch on a level with the apostolic see. This appeal to
them was made simultaneously 011 1110 supposition that they

could not act otherwise than in concert, and the issue
invariably justified this assumption. When the appeal was
made to Milan alone, as the Gallican Bishops are known
to have done on several occasions, it was only because Milan
was nearer to them and for this reason had a better
opportunity 01 obtaining information. Questions continued
to be submitted to Rome all the same. We may point out
as instances of such appeals, those of Himerius, Bishop
of Tarragona, in 384, 01 Victricius‚ Bishop 01 Rouen, in 403,
and of Exuperius, Bishop 01 Το11101150, 111 404. We still
possess the decretals 01 Siricius and Innocent‚l in which
they replied to the questions submitted by these bishops
of Spain and Gaul.

The pre-eminent position, however, of the see 01 Milan
could 1101 have been further accentuated without in the end
establishing a precedent which might be cited against the
pre-eminence 01 Rome. The Popes soon realised this, and
neglected no opportunity 01 defending themselves against
this incipient rivalry. It 15 1101 known what part they took
in the foundation of the metropolitan see 01 Aquileia, but it
is certain that they helped to create the metropolitan diocese
01 Ravenna, formed at the expense 01 that 01 Milan.2 In a
letter addressed to the Bishop 01 Eugubium, his suffragan,
Pope Innocent points out, not without a certain incisiveness

1 Jaffei, 255, 286, 293. We may add the Synodus Romanorum ad Gallos
Episcopos (Constant, Epp. Rom. Pontis„ p. 685), of which it 15 impossible
to say whether it was drawn up under Siricius or Innocent. It is certainly

of that date.
