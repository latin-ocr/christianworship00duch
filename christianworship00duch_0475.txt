the prayers at cock-crow and those at dawn (Lauds).
At a much later date the same result was attained by the
introduction of the office of Οο111ΡΗΈ16,1 between the evening
meal and the time of retiring to rest. It is the system of
Prudentius combined with that of Tertullian.

The study of these diversities leads us into the special
history of monastic discipline. A point of more general
interest was the introduction of daily prayers into eccle-
siastical use proper. The author of the Apostolic Consti-
tutions insists even in his day that the bishop should
require the faithful to attend the morning and evening
offices, and even those of the three day—hours,2 He takes
for granted that these offices are said in the church‚ and
that the bishop and his elergy take part in them. The
Pilgrimage of Etheria (Silvia) furnishes very definite informa-
tion on this point as far as the special usage of the Church

of Jerusalem is concerned.3 Except during Lent‚ when the
hour of tiarae was recited in public, there were four daily

meetings in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre—at cock-
crow, at seoet, at none, and at vespers (lucernarium). The
sacred edifice, which was not, be it remarked‚ the mother
chureh or eathedral of Jerusalem, but merely a sanc-
tuary of relatively restricted dimensions‚ was open to every
one who wished to enter. As a matter of fact, the con-
gregation was principally composed of ascetics of both sexes
(monazontes and parthenae). These pious persons sang
psalms, either according to the ancient method of responds‚
or by means of two chous, antiphonally. Two or three
