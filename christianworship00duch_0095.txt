THE MAss IN THE EAsr. 75

ᾗ 4.-ΤΗΕ ALEXANDRINE LITURGY.

1. The Ezwholoyz'on of Sarapion.

With regard to Christian Egypt, we possessed, until lately,
no ancient liturgical text which could compare with that
of the Syrian Apostolic Constitutions. This want has been
supplied by the discovery, in a manuscript at Mount Athos,
of a collection of prayers‚ two of which bear the name of
Sarapion, Bishop of Thmuis, a friend and correspondent
of St. Athanasius.1 1t is probable that the others are of
the same authorship. The collection comprises thirty com-
positions, connected respectively with the eucharistie liturgy
(1-6), with baptism (7-11), with ordination (liz-14), with
the blessing of the oils (15-17), with funerals (18), and with
the office for Sunday (19-30). It is to the latter that a

sort of final rubrio seems to refer—‘⁶ All these prayers come
before that of the Oblation.''

The prayer of the Oblation is the first of the series
referred to, and is an Anaphom. The text 2 is as follows :—

ancient custom, this high dignitary is subordinate to the Archbishop of
Caesarea in Cappadocia; his position is analogous to that of the Catholicos
of Seleucia and of the Abuna of the Ethiopians. The united Armenians
have not even the equivalent of a catholicos, for the Archbishop of
Leopol is in no way subordinate to the Patriarch of Cilicia. Like him,
116 is directly under the Pope, without any intermediary.

¹ The credit of this discovery is due to Herr G. Wobbermin, who has
published these texts in the Texta und Untersuokunqen of Gebhardt and
Harnack (new series, vol. ii.).

² [At the rcquest of Mgr. Duchesne, the Bishop of Salisbury's translation
from the original is here substituted for his own. Speaking of the latter,
Mgr. Duchesne dwells upon the word ἀγένητος used in the original, and
says]‚ It will no doubt excite astonishment that in this composition of a
friend of St. Athanasius, there should be a kind of predilection for
the term infinitus, with the corresponding words, uniyenituS, qenitus
so much in vogue in the Arianising world. In spite of this awkward termino-
logy, perhaps due to custom, the redaction is most strictly orthodox.
