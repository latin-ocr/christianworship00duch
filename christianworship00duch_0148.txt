126 OHRISTIAN WORSHIP: 1Ts omem AND EVOLUTION.

based on these three manuscripts and collated afresh, has
been published at Oxford.1

None of these copies bears the name of Gelasius.
Tommasi‚ however, who applied it to the text which he
published‚ did no more, as will be seen, than revive a
designation in use in the ninth century?

In the inventory of the liturgica] books at the abbey of
St. Riquier,3 we find Gregorian “ Missals,” Gelasian Missals,
and a mixed MissaL stffissalis Greyoriamcs et Gelasimus
modernis temporibus ab Albino ordinatus. Walafrid Strabo 4
mentions that Gelasius was supposed to have arranged in
order the prayers composed by himself and others, and
adds that the Churches of the Gauls made use of his
prayem, and that many still continue to do so, but that
St. Gregory, struck with the imperfectiori of Gelasius's
book, revised it, and made of it the Gregorian Liber Sacra-
mentorum. These two testimonies are both of the first
half of the ninth century. Fifty years later, John the
Deaeon, in his Life of St. G7269072ffi5 used nearly the same
expressions as Walafrid Strabo. It was therefore believed
in the ninth century that a Sacramentary of Gelasius had
existed, and that the Gregorian Sacramentary was merely
a revision of it. By Gregorian Sacramentary was evidently
meant the Sacramentary of Adrian, such as Ι have de-
scribed it, bearing as its heading the name of Saint Gregory.
But what was understood by the Gelasian SacramentaryZ

² Before Tommasi’s time, Morin and Bona had already giventhe name
Gelasian to the text which Tommasi afterwards published, and with which
they had a first-hand acquaintancesliip.

⁵ ΙΙ. 17: ‘⁴ Gelasianum codicem de missarum solemniis, multa subtrahens,
pauca convertens, nonnulla vero superadiciens pro exponendis evangelicis
lectionibus, in unius libri volumine coartavit.’'
