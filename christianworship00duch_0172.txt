150 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

granted throughout that the Pope is present and
officiating.l

The Ordo 01 the stational Mass, in the state in which
it has come down to us, is certainly later than the time
01 St. Gregory. We find in it several directions which
we know to have been introduced by him. For instance,
in the Pope's escort defenders of the regions are
mentioned, dignitaries whose office was created by St.
Gregory32 the gradual is sung by a cantor, and not
by a deacon‚ in conformity with the rule laid down by
the Roman Council 01 595; 1110 Pater Noster is placed
before the Pax Domini, an alteration which St. Gregory
himself states that he made3 It would not, however, be
correct to affirm that the whole of the ritual goes back
to the time of St. Gregory and to the beginning 01 the
seventh century. The mention of the deaoonries, the
designation 01 the Palace of the Lateran by the name 01
Ρατφ·1“ανο]ινᾷῖωη,4 the marked development of the papa]
court,—all point to the later part of the seventh century.
Moreover‚ we have the mention of the Aquas Dei, and this
hymn 15 known to have been introduced by Pope Sergius
(687-701).⁵ μ 11 15 therefore quite to the end 01 1110 seventh,
if not to the following century, that Ι should assign the
redaction of the Ordo, as We possess it. Indeed, we must
give even a later date, if we are to include some of the
supplements, for in one 01 111050 (c. 24) we find the name
of Charlemagne, and a reference to the time (already past)
of the pontificate of Adrian. If we take into consideration
this additional part, the Ordo cannot be earlier than 795.
