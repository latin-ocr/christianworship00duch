THE ROMAN MAss. 163

The Ordines of the eighth century represent them as wearing
their liturgica] vestments, and as preceded by the sub-
deacons, one of whom swings a censer,1 and by seven
acolytes carrying tapers.2 During this procession the
choir (schola cantorum) sings the antiphon ad introitum.
Originally this antiphon consisted of the singing of a com-
plete psalm, or, at least, of several verses of it. It con-
tinued to be sung until the pontiff had reached the altar.
Before he did so, he was met by a cleric, who brought to
him a fragment of consecrated bread, which was reserved
from a previous Mass. This eucharistic portion was in-
tended to be placed in the chalice before the ceremony
of the “fraction of the bread.¹' On entering the sanctuar-y
the Pope gave the kiss of peace to the senior bishop
and senior priest‚ and then to all his deacons. He
thereupon proceeded to prostrate himself before the holy
table. A few minutes before his arrival there, the book
of the Gospels had been solemnly brought and placed upon
the altar. After the Pope's prostratim, the deacons pro-
ceeded two by two and kissed the altar on its sides. The
pontiff also, drawing near, kissed the altar, as well as the
book of the Gospels.

It is difficult to assign a precise date to this cere-
mony. In all rituals the entry of the officiating minister
was from an early time associated with some pomp. We
shall not go far wrong, however, if we refer to the fifth

¹ Judging from the Ordines and other liturgical books, as well as from
the inventories of Church furniture which we find in the Liber Ponti-
ficalis, the portable censer was used at Rome, up to the ninth century, only
in processions. The route which the coo-teqe had to follow was thus
made sweet-smelling with incense. As for censing the altar, or the chureh,
or the clergy or congregation, such a thing is never mentioned.

² I fancy that there must have been some connection between the
custom of carrying, on certain occasions, tapers before the Pope and before
the book of the Gospels, and the tapers figuring among the insignia of
the highest dignitaries of the Roman Empire in the Notitia cliqnitatum

imperii.
