6. Ordines Romani.

In the second volume of his Musaeum Italicum} Mabillon
published some of the Ordines Romam, or ritual directions for
different ceremonies. All these documents are not of the
same date, and it is possible to traoe in them modifications
which were made in the Pontifieal Liturgy from the ninth
to the fifteenth centuries. It is only with the most ancient
that We have to deal here, and We must of course put
aside those which correspond to the Roman Liturgy as it
has been modified owing to various influenoes, whether in
Franoe or at Rome, Subsequent to the ninth century. I
shall therefore select only Nos. L, VII.‚ VIII„ and IX.
out of the whole series of the Ordines. The first of these
relates to the liturgy of the Mass, the seoond to baptism,
and the two others to the ceremonies at ordination.

We must, moreover, distinguish between 13110 different
parts of the Ordo Romanus I. as it is published by
Mabillon. The whole of it, indeed, is taken from manu-
scripts of 1110 11111111 century, and it may be taken for
granted that all of it existed in the early years of that
century. But 011 1110 parts do 1101 exhibit 10 1110 501110
extent 0 Roman impress.

After an introduction relating 10 1110 apportioning of
the liturgioal service among the olerios of the seven
regions of Rome, the Ordo gives 115 0 description of the
5101101101 Μο55, presided over by the Pope. This first
part comprises Chapters 1—21 of Mabillon.

It is found, With 011 abrupt break at this point, in
several manuscripts cited by Mabillon and others, and
especially in 11101 of Verona, published by Fr. Bianehini.2
