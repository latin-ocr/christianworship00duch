East conformed to the paschal computation as proposed by
the Bishop of Alexandria.l

4. Numberless difficulties again cropped up in the fourth
and fifth centuries, owing to the differences between the
Alexandrian and Roman computations. These difficulties
arose from certain differences in calculation and custom.
The determination of the age of the moon, as it was
calculated at Rome, was founded on imperfect lunar cycles.
It was often at variance with that of Alexandria, which was
based on the cycle of nineteen years. On the other hand,
the Romans did not admit that Easter Sunday could fall, in
the lunar month, before the ioth of that month, whereas at
Alexandria Easter might be kept on the l5th. Finally, a
tradition was supposed to exist at Rome according to
which Easter could not be observed after the let of April.
This limitation was unknown at Alexandria, where it might
be held up to the 25th. The conflicts arising from these
differences were, for the most part, amicably settled between
the Pope and the Greek Church, and when Rome adopted the
Alexandrian computation‚ under the form given to it by
Dionysius Exiguus 2 (525), they at length finally disappeared.

5. Mention must also be made of the divergence between
the paschal tables of Victorius of Aquitaine and Dionysius
Exiguus. The table of the former, drawn up at Rome
in 457, was not long in use there, if indeed it ever was
