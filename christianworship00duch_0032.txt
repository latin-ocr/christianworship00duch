to the Christian Church. It is a mistake to suppose with some
that the documents of the fourth and fifth centuries afford
ground for belief that the bishop had a share in the govern-
ment of the city. It is not only impossible to demonstrate,
but absolutely incompatible with the ecclesiastical law of
the period with which we are dealing, that the clergy were
identified with the curia, and that the bishop, under the title
of defensor civitatis, took his place among the municipal
magistrates. There is not any doubt that moral influence
may have made itself felt, and that in the fourth and fifth
centuries the religious rulers may indirectly have played a
part in the government of the towns. But both in theory
and practice the Church and the city, the clergy and the
curia, the bishop and the municipal magistrates, continued
to keep the limits of their respective domains distinct.

In one respect only, and that 611 important one, the
administrative organisation of the Empire exercised 6
real influence on the development of ecclesiastical insti-
tutions. I refer to the areas of jurisdiction, municipal,
provincial, or otherwise.

At the outset no question had been raised with regard to
local limits. The J ewish colonies were always confined to the
towns, and this was also the case with regard to the early
Christian communities. As Christianity spread into the
smaller towns and the country districts, it became necessary
to know where the territory of each Church began and where
it ended. The cities of the Empire, with their territories
clearly marked out by the census, here presented limits
already defined, against which no reason of a religious nature
could be raised, It was admitted generally that each city
should have its own bishop, and that its population should con-
stitute a Church by 116611. These areas, it is true, were very
unequal. In some countries they were really provinces, 66,
for instance, Poitiers, Bourges, and many others in Gaul. In
Africa, on the other hand, in Southern Italy, and in Western
