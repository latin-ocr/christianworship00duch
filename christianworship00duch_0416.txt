5. The Stole.

The bishops were not the only ecclesiastical dignitaries
to receive a special distinguishing mark. The priests
and deacons had also their respective insignia. Here,
however, we must pause to distinguish between the
Roman custom and that of other countries. At Rome,
the wearing of insignia seems to have met with little
favour, as we have already seen from the letter of Pope
Celestine to the Bishops of Provence. This is more
clearly accentuated by the fact that the orarium of the
priest and deacon, considered as a conspicuous mark of
distinction, was unknown there, certainly as late as the
tenth century, whereas elsewhere it was universally adopted.
The orarium is doubtless mentioned in the Ordines of the
ninth century, but we see there also that this vestment
was worn by acolytes and subdeacons as well as by the
superior orders, and that its place was under the outer
garment, whether dalmatic or planeta, and not over it.
This orarium was merely the ancient sudarium (hand-

¹ The bishops of the suburbicarian diocese were in a much more sub-
ordinate position with regard to the Pope than other bishops were with
their metropolitans. They were obliged to come to Rome to be consecrated,
and the consecration was performed by the Pope alone, without the con-
currence of other bishops. They had not the right also to found rural
Churches without the Pope's authorisation. An examination of the registers
of Gelasius, Pelagius, and St. Gregory will suffice to show the difference
in the administration of the Roman province and that of Arles, for instance,
or Milan. Like the African bishops, the prelates of South Italy strike us
as occupying the position of important parish priests, rather than that of
actual rulers of dioceses.
