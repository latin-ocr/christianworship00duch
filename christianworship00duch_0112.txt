towards the end of the fourth century and in the early years
of the fifth, a kind of superior metropolis to which the whole
of the West was inclined to look. We have seen that the
Bishops of Gaul and Spain were accustomed to proceed
thither frequently to procure solutions of difficulties and
rules of conduct.l The imperial city was admirably situated
to afford a model in the matter of worship and of liturgy.
What cannot be allowed to Lyons is readily granted in the
case of Milan. From the moment when Rome became no
longer the centre of attraction‚ from the moment when
inspiration was sought elsewhere, Milan could not fail to
have the preference over all other Churches.2 And it is
worthy of note that the time to which we have assigned
these relations between Milan and the transalpine Churches
of the WVest corresponds with a period in which a consider-
able number of these Churches were undergoing an internal
organisation and development, or even in process of being
founded.3 This was the time in which the masses in the
towns were converted, in which Ohurches were reconstructed
on a larger scale, in which it was necessary to increase
the number of the clergy and to lay down with precision the
rules regulating discipline and public worship. The influence

¹ The remcmbrance of this influence is still active in the middle of
the sixth century, as we see from a sermon prcached at Constantinople by
Dacius, Bishop of Milan: “Ecce ego et pars omnium sacerdotum inter
quos ecclesia mea constituta est, id est Galliae, Burgundiae„ Spaniam,
Liguriae, Aemiliae atque Venetiae, contestor quia quicumque in edicta ista
consenserit, suprascriptarum provinciarum pontifices communicatores habere
non poterit, quia constat apud me edicta ista sanctam synodum Chalce-
donensem et fidem catholicam perturbare ⁷' (Ep. clericorum Italiae, Migne,
P. Lem, vol. lxix. p. 117).

² It is worth while to recall here how the finding of the martyrs at
Milan in the time of St. Ambrose called forth in Gaul a responsive feeling.
It is to this epoch, and in consequence of these relations, that the dedication
of so many Churches in Gaul under the invocations of St. Gervais and
St. Nazaire are to be assigned.

³ Many Churches in Gaul were founded in the fourth century, ic. in
the time of Constantine and his sons
