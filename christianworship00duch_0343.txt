OEREMONIES or GHRis'rrAN INITIATION. 319

The insufflation appears also in the rites enumerated by
St. Isidore. It is also found in the Bobbio Sacramentary‚
and according to this authority it was administered three
several times on the face of the candidate, the officiating
minister saying, Accipe Spiritum sanctum et in eorde teneas.

2. Preparation for Baptism.

We have no information with regard to the number and
order of the Gallican scrutinies. All that remains of this
part of the ritual are the two formularies of prayer in the
Missale Gallicanum, where they appear under the title of
Praemissiones ad serutamen.

On the other hand, the Traditio Symbolz' is often men-
tioned. It took place on the Sunday before Easter. We
have the testimony of St. Ambrose on this point, besides
trustworthy attestations in Gaul and Spain.l The Bishop
himself presided at this ceremony, which was placed between
the Mass of the catechumens and that of the faithful. He
began by an address, and then, having recited the Apostles'
Creed three times he proceeded to give an exposition of it
article by article?

1 Ambr., Ep„ 20: “ Sequenti die, erat autem dominica (Sunday before
Eastm), post lectiones atque tractatum, dimissis catechumenis, symbolum
aliquibus competentibus in baptisteriis tradebam basilieae.” Counoil of
Agde (506), c. 3: ‘⁶ Symbolum etiam placuit ab omnibus ecclesiis una die, id
est ante octo dies dominicae Remi-rectionis, publice in ecclesiis competentibus
tradi.'' St. Germain of Paris and all the liturgical books, together with
Isidore and Ildefonsus (loc. cit.)‚ mention the same Sunday. Cf. Mabillon,
Mus. Ital„ vol. i. p. 95, and the Mozarabic Missal for Palm Sunday.

² The Missale Gallicanum contains two formularies for the Traditio
symboli, one entire, the other imperfect owing to a lacuna ; and there is
a third in the Bobbio Sacramentary. These two books contain, besides,
with some slight abbreviations‚ the Roman ceremony of the Apertio
aurium. Their complexity on this point agrees with the general character
