THE MAss IN THE EAST. 77

sacrifice, this bloodless oblation. To Thee we have offered this bread
the likeness (ὁμοίωμα) of the Body of the Only-begotten. This bread
is the likeness of the Holy Body, because the Lord Jesus Christ in the
night in which He was betrayed took bread and broke and gave
to His disciples saying, “Take ye and eat, this is My Body, which is
being broken for you for remission of sins '' (cp. Lit. of St. Mark, eta).
W'herefore we also making the likeness of the death have offered the
bread, and beseeoh Thee through this sacrifice, be reconciled to all of us
and be merciful, Ο God of Truth : and as this ’¹‘ bread had been scattered
on the top of the mountains and gathered together came to be one, so
also gather Thy holy Church out of '¹‘ every nation and every country and
every city and village and house and make one living Catholic Ghurch.
We have offered also the cup, the likeness of the Blood, because the
Lord Jesus Christ, taking a cup after supper, said to His own disciples,
“ Take ye, drink, this is the new covenant‚ which (ὅ) is My Blood, which
is being shed for you for remission of sins (ἄμαρτημάτων>.” Wherefore
we have also offered the cup, presenting a likeness of the blood.

O God of Truth, let Thy Holy Wordl come upon this bread (ἐπιδη-
μησάτω . . . ἐπὶ mecm), that the bread may become Body of the Word,
and upon this cup that the cup may become Blood of the Truth; and
make all who communicate to receive a medicine of life for the healing of
every sickness and for the strengthening of all advanoement and virtue,
not for condemnation, O God of Truth⁷ and not for censure and reproach.
For we have invoked Thee, the uncreated, through the Only-begotten in
Holy spirit.

Let this people receive mercy, let it be counted worthy of advance-
ment, let angels be sent forth as companions to the people for bringing
to naught of the evil one and for establishment of the Ghuroh.

We intercede also on behals of all who have been laid to rest, whose
memorial we are making.

After the recitation (ὑποβολήν †) of the names : Sanctify these souis: for
Thou knowest all. Sanctify all (souls) laid to rest in the Lord. And
number them with all Thy holy powerS‚ and give to them a place and.
a mansion in Thy kingdom.

Receive also the thanksgiving (eucharist) of the people, and bless
those who have offered the offerings (τὰ πρόσφορα) and the thanksgivings,
