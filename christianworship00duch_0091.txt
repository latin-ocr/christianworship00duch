3. Ooesarea and Constantinople.

We have previously seen that, towards the 'end of
the third century, and during a considerable part of the
fourth, the Ghurches of Asia Minor, and especially those
of Cappadocia, Pontus, and Bithynia, had close and
frequent relations with the see of Antioch. It was from
Antioch, moreover, that the Grospel was carried towards
these regions Caesarea had looked to Antioch before
owning obedience to Constantinople. It was by the
bishops who came from Antioch or Caesarea—Gregory
N azianzen, Nectarius, Chrysostom, N estorius—that the
Church of Constantinople was ruled at the period when
it received its final organisation.1 It is, therefore, not
surprising that its liturgy reproduces all the essential
features of the Syrian Liturgy?

This liturgy is now used over an immense area. It
has ended by supplanting the older liturgies in all v
the Greek patriarchates of the East. It is in use in
the National Church of Greece and in those of Servia,
Bulgaria, Russia, Roumania, etc.3 It is true that, in these

ancient manuscripts, we must have recourse if we wish 1ο reconstruct
antiquity.

1 The Arian bishop Eudoxus (360-370) also came from the environs
of Antioch.

² The Council of Laodicea, in the fourth century, has preserved
for us some interesting liturgical details: 69. lections alternating with
hymns (c, 17), homilies, prayers, the dismissal of catechumens and
penitents, the threefold prayer of the faithful, in silence in the first
instance, and twice aloud, and finally the kiss of peace and the oblation
(c. 19).

³ The ecclesiastical groups connected theoretically with the Greek
Patriarchate of Constantinople are: 151, 1116 Holy Synod of Athens (King-
dom of Greece); 2nd, the Holy synod of Petersburg (Russian Empire>3
3rd, the Servian Patriarchate of Carlowitz (Servia in Austro-Hungary);
