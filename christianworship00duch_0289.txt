THE CHRISTIAN FESTIVALS. 265ss

2. The Festivals after Ohristmas.

The festival of the Nativity having been once fixed,
there were associated with it, and that too from an early
date, certain commemorations connected with the greatest
saints of the New Testament. St. Gregory of Nyssa, in
his funeral oration over St. Basil, preached at the Cap—
padocian Caesarea in 379, states that it was customary after
Christmas and before the lst of January to celebrate the
festivals of St. Stephen, St. Peter, St. James, St. John, and
St. Paul. This statement is confirmed by the Syriae

Menologion published by Mr. Wright from a manuscript
of the date 4121 Ι have made a study of the text of the
latter, and have shown that it is merely an abridgment
of a Greek Martyrology of Asia Minor, of which a more
complete form was embodied in the Latin compilation
called the Hieronymian Martyrology. The Greek Mar-
tyrology must have been drawn up within the last three
decades of the fourth century 3 it is even possible that the
first redaction may have been a little earlier.2 It is, there-
fore, in the main, of the same date and country as St. Basil
and St. Gregory of Nyssa. There is nothing to prove, how-
ever, that the festivals which we are about to mention were
inscribed in it from the beginning. We have on this point
merely the testimony of the Syriae abridgment, of which the
provenanee was Edessa, or some other oriental locality‚ where
Syriae was the current language in ecclesiastica] use. The
following are the days after Christmas which it contains 3 :—

¹ Journal of sacred Lit„ vol. viii„ London, 1865-66, pp. 45, 423.

² Les Sources du Martyroloqe Hieronymi-en, in the Melan-(763 de Z'Ecole de
Rome, 1885. Since the appearance of the first edition I have published this
Syriae Menologion in the Acta SS. Novembris, vol. ii. p. [lii.].

³ I follow here the Syriae Menologion. In the Hieronymian Martyrology
the festivals of St. Peter and St. Paul have been transferred, according to
Roman custom, to the 29th of June
