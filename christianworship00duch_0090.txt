70 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

The most characteristic feature of the liturgies of
N estorian origin is the position assigned to the Great
Supplicatum, or Memento. lustead of following the Epielesis,
as in the Syrian Liturgy‚ it is placed before, and imme-

Anamnesis.
The following are the texts which are at present known

of these liturgies.

l. An Anaphora of the sixth century, first published
by Herr Biokessl and, after re-examination of the manu·

2. The Liturgy of SS. Adaeus and Maris, founders of the

liturgy in its curtailed form as found in the text attributed
to SS. Adaeus and Maris, to the Patriarch J esuyab HL,

no mention of the texts printed for actual liturgieal use. Those which are
used by the Catholic communities have suffered from alterations which have
been made with more zeal than knowledge. It is not to these books, but to
