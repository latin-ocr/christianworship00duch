270 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

The Church of Rome seems to have celebrated no

festival of the Virgin before the seventh century, when
it adopted the four Byzantine festivals, of which I will

speak presently.1

The Gospel2 furnishes, in regard to the festival of
St. John Baptist, a fragment of information which has not
been neglected. The birth of the Forerunner of. our Lord
must have preceded that of the Saviour by six months.
I suspect, notwithstanding, that the festival of the 24th
of June was preceded, at least in the East, by another
commemoration, which was observed about Christmastide.
We have seen what the N estorian use was in this respect,
and we find that in the Armenian Ghurch also the festival
of the Forerunner of our Lord was the first which was
observed after Epiphany.3 The Calendar of Perpetuus,
Bishop of Tours (filei—490), places the Nazala S. ,Iohannis
between the Epiphany and cathedra Petri, that is, exactly

at the same period in the year.4

This festival was replaced later on by another, that of
the Pession, or Decollation of St. John, observed on the
29111 of August, which was adopted in Gallican regions and

in Constantinople before it was followed at Rome.⁵

Lent and of the paschal festivals did not allow of its adoption.

of 1116 lst of J anuary at Rome.

¹ In the Calendar of Carthago, under the 27111 of December we read, S.
Johanm’s Baptistae et Jacobi Apostoli quem Herodes occidit, but we have
every reason to believe that this was an error of the copyist, who read
Baptistae in place of Evcmyelistcce.

⁵ For Constantinoplo see Martinov, Annus Eccl. Graeco-Slavicus‚ p. 210.
In the Hieronymian Martyrology and the Gelasian Sacramentary the
festival is placed on the 29111 of August. All the Gallican liturgical books
have a Mass for the Passion of St. John, which they place at a greater or
less distance after that of the Nativity of the same saint, but without
