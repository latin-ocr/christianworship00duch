has no heading) is simply Liber sacramentorum Romanae
Ecclesiae, without the name of any Pope. As to the text
itself, it contains a great number of things posterior, not
only to St. Gelasius‚ but to St. Gregory. It is therefore
not the Sacramentary itself that can have suggested its
attribution to Gelasius‚ neither ean I believe that it was
handed down by tradition. The Gelasian Sacramentary is
derived from official books which were in use in Rome
about the end of the seventh century. It is not easy to
believe that at that date a Gelasian Liturgy existed at Rome.
At that period everything followed the Gregorian tradition,
not that· there was any shrinking from the introduction
of needful modifications‚ but even when changes were made,
they were supposed to follow on the lines of the Gregorian
use. It was from this method of representing things that
the appellation of Gregorian Sacramentary was applied with-
out the slightest hesitation by Pope Adrian to a book
much later than St. Gregory’s date. If the Roman books
that we find in use in France before the time of Adrian
and Charlemagne had borne the name of any Pope, it
would doubtless have been that of St. Gregory. We can,
however, without having recourse to a far-fetehed tradition,
explain how the designation of Gelasian Sacramentary arose.
It appears to have been first used by Frankish scholare
of the ninth century, who moved in a sphere in which
liturgica] matters and ecclesiastical history were of absorb-
ing interest. The Liber Pontz'fi'calis was known to these
writers, and was regarded as a great authority. When its
pages were consulted for information concerning the books
of the Roman Litmgy, it was indeed rightly found that
St. Leo and St. Gregory had added some words to the
canon of the Mass, but that St. Gelasius was the only Pope
who is mentioned by his biographer as the author of a Liber
sacramentorum. Again‚ on closer inspection‚ it is clear that
in the life of Gelasius merely prefaces and isolated prayers
