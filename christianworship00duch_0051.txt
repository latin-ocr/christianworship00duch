ECCLESIASTICAL AREAs. 31

by the Po, in the Danubian provinceS‚ in Gaul, Spain, and
Britain, whether owing to the fact that the cities in these
regions included a large extent of territory, or that it was
not thought advisable to place a bishop in each, the epis-
copal areas were more extensive and numerically smaller.
This fact probably accounts for the late grouping of them
into provinces and assigning them metropolitans. In Nor-
thern Italy there was at first one metropolitan only, that of
Milan, whose jurisdiction extended over the whole diocese of
Italy so called. Towards the beginning of the fifth century
this province was made into two by the formation of the
metropolitan see of Aquileia. A little later the province of
Emilia furnished some suffragans to the Bishop of Ravenna,
when this town became the Imperial residence. Ravenna,
however, was included within the area of the metropolitan
rule of the Pope, and hence its bishop remained a suffragan
of the Roman see, although he was himself metropolitan
of the sees of the province of Emih'a which had been
detached from that of Milan.

Britain and the Pannonian provinces were separated from
the Empire before the system of ecclesiastical metropolitans
could be introduced into them respectively. At all events
there is no documentary evidence to the contrary. In
the fifth and sixth centurieS, what remained of the Upper
Danubian provinces was divided between the two Italian
metropolitan sees of Milan and Aquileia. Rhaetia Prima
(Goire) was under the jurisdiction of Milan 3 Rhaetia Secunda
(Augsburg, Seben), Noricum (Tiburnia)‚ Pannonia Prima
(Scarbantia), formed part of the Oouncil of Aquileia.l
In Gaul and Spain the metropolitan system was introduced
