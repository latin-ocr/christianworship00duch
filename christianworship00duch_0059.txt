Ravenna. They appointed as his successor Patroclus, who
was in great favour with Constantius, but who was an
ambitious, intriguing, and avaricious man, and at the same
time clever and audacious. Pope Zosimus, who had been
prepossessed beforehand in favour 01 11113 individua] and
had been deceived as to his moral character, hastened, on
succeeding to the pontificate, to grant him letters which
invested him with powers superior to all the bishops of the
two administrative dioceses 01 Gaul and of the Seven
Provinces. The Pope, by the intermediary of this his
