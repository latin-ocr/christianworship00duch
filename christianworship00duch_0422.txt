396 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

procedere. The similarity of the word camelaucum to the
Greek term καμηλαῦκιου shows that a covering for the head
is here meant. Sixty years later, the author of the salse
Donation of Constantine gives a description of it and ex-
plains its origin. The Emperor Constantine desired to give
his Imperial crown to St. Silvester, but the saint having
out of humility refused it, the emperor placed on his
head a white Phrygian cap,1 friyz'um candido nitore, and
granted to him and his successors the right to wear it
in processions after the manner of a sovereign. This dis-
tinguishing head-dress does not appear, as far as Ι am
aware‚ upon any monument prior to the twelfth century,
when we find it in the paintings of the ancient Church of
San Clemente at Rome. In these frescoes, the cap, which is
conical in form, rises from a jewelled circlet3 but this crown
must have been added subsequently to the eighth century, for
the salse Donation of Constantine implies that it was not
then in use. The second crown is not met with in any
representations before the time of Boniface V111.; the
third was added by one of the Popes of Avignon.

7. The White Saddle-cloth of the Roman Cleryy.

The Donation of Constantine mentions another distin-
guishing mark, not peculiar to the Pope alone, but to
members of the Roman clergy in general—that is, the
white covering (mappula or mappulum) 2 of linen of a
silky texture, which the clergy had the right of placing
over the saddles of their horses on the days when processions

1 The papal tiara and the Phrygian cap have thus a real though some-
what distant connection. The mitre of the bishops, which is only a glorified
hood, takes its origin from a cowl (cucullus), which in olden times was an

article of apparel of the working classes and the poorer peasa-ntry.
