legislation in that direction was upheld by or even prompted
by the tendency of general opinion. These who have given
way to laxity do not regard with disfavour the small body
of courageous souls who undertake to bear the burdens which
they themselves will no longer attempt to lift. With

considered incumbent either on the faithful in general, or
on the community as represented by the clergy and their
assistants—bishops‚ priests, deacons‚ deaconesses‚ and humbler
ministers,

The principal motive of the profession of virginity was the
assumption that such a manner of life, being superior to the
forces of nature, reflected special honour on Christianity.1
The virgins of both sexes—but especially the women, 011
account of their peculiar frailty—were regarded as an
honour to the Church, the most precious jewels in her
crown. Thus, far from hiding· them behind walls and
gratings, special delight was taken by the Church in putting
them forward. The confessors and the sacred virgins, to
whom were added the widows who, after a short marriage,
had remained steadfast in their profession of widowhood,
constituted a sort of aristocracy in the cominunity of the
faithful, obtained special mention in their prayers,2 and
had a distinct place rosei-ved for them in the church. Marks
of respect were voluntarily shown them, and the matrone
did not leave the sacred place of assembly without coming
to ask the holy kiss of the consecrated virgins.

preserved in tho liturgy for Good Friday (cf. above, p. 173), the <maeatae of
