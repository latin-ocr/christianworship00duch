on the model of that of Palestine, was established there.
With regard to the Mass at dawn, it was originally in honour
of St. Anastasia of Sirmium, a saint who became popular
at Oonstantinople after the translation of her relics under
the Patriarch Gennadius (458-471). The Byzantine colony,
which from the middle of the sixth century had grown up at
Rome, established this new cult in the old titulus Anastasiae,
a church situated at the foot of the Palatine. As this
building constituted a sort of special metropolitan church
for the Greek quarter‚ and was in close proximity to the
official staff of the Palatine, the festival of St. Anastasia
assumed an extraordinary importance, and continued to be
observed in spite of its coinciding with the celebration of
Christmas. A third Station was thus formed, and was
intercalated between the two others. In other places than
Rome, where there was neither a church of St. Anastasia
nor a Byzantine colony, no reason existed for celebrating a
solemn Mass on the anniversary of the Martyr of Sirmium.1
The custom of having three Masses waS, however, preserved3
but the Mass at dawn, like the two others, was said in
honour of our Lord's Nativity, and St. Anastasia no longer
figures in it, except in a mere commemoration.2

¹ It is a somewhat remarkable fact that this Byzantine cultus should
have succeeded in establishing itself, notwithstanding the dominant claime
of the festival of Christmas. Various Roman saints also, of whom the best-
known was St. Eugenia, had their anniversaries on the 25th of December,
and they are still marked in the Leonine Sacramentary, but in course of
time they were all eliminated.
