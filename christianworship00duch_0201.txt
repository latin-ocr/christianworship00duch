THE ROMAN MAss. 179

diqnum et justum est, etc, In the Sacramentary 01 Adrian,
this form, that is to say, the Prefhm, admits only a small
number 01 variations 101 1116 011161 festivals. Previously

ν 111656 variations were much more numerous. We would
⁷ gather from the Leonian Sacramentary that improvisation‚
⁷ or at the least the intercalation 01 66116111 sentences pre-

viously composed by the officiating priest‚ was still the
practice in the sixth century. The Preface ends with an
ascription to the glory of God, and the Sanetus.

After the Sanetus the Roman Canon, instead 01 proceeding
at once to the account 01 the Last Supper‚ intercalates a
long passage appropriated to the enumeration 01 1116 persons
in whose name the oblation is made—the whole Catholic
Chumh, the Pope (or, 11 occasion requires it, the bishop 01
1116 10061119), and all the orthodox bishops; then the
Sovereign and the congregation3 and finally, as represent-
ing the Communion 01 8611115, 611 1116 righteous who have
already attained the heavenly beatitude—the Virgin Mary,
the Apostles, and their successors the Popes, martyrs, and
other saints. The oblation is thus made by the whole
Christian family, and God is asked to accept it, and to
transform it into the Body and Blood 01 Christ.

The existing texts 101 11115 part 01 1116 Canonl give
forms which are definitely fixed, but 1101 50 much so,
however, that provision has not been made for additions
with the object 01 commemorating the festival of the day
or 101 1116 enumeration 01 06116111 persons 01 classes 01
persons. Thus, there is no doubt that the names 01 1116 four
patriarchs 01 1116 Ε651, and possibly 01 certain Western
primates, were formerly mentioned in the Te igitur 61161

fratrum mentes dicendo: Sursum corda, ut, dum respondet plebs Habemus
ad Dominum, ad1n0neatur‚⁷' etc, These versicles appear already in the
Ganones Hippofyti (see Appendix).

¹ That is, the prayers which begin with the words, Te v‘yituffi Mvmcuw,
Conana'micantea Isma- ffqitur, aud Quam oblationem.
