Five short prayers follow in the manuscript. The first
was said at the moment of the fraeti0n3 the second, over the
people, upon whom there was an imposition of hands

Then follows a blessing of the offered oil and water which
were to 106 used 111 private as phylacteries, and lastly the
blessing of the assembly at the moment of dismissal.

As to the formularies whioh terminate the Eucholoyion

it that these two prayers presuppose the presence of those
who are still outside the pale of Christianity, though they
may be disposed to embraoe it, or, at least, to 106 instruoted

deaeons‚ sub-deacons, leotors‚ interpreters,1 ascetae (μονά-
ζοντες), virgins, and married people. Next we have (26)
6 “prayer of genuflection,'' which deals with the names
inscribed in the book of life. Perhaps this had some oon-
neetion with the reoitation of the diptyohs. The prayer
