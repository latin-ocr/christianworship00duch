assembly of the faithful. The latter portion corresponds
with the Roman ceremony of the depositio, but it contains
certain details which resemble those in the consecration
of the altar by water and anointing. The Frankish
liturgiologists of the eighth and ninth centuries, who
took 10 meddling with the two rituals by combining
them, were not always elever enough to avoid confusions
and repetitions. More complicatione were the result in

procedure was not everywhere adopted, and the Ordines
which I publish exhibit different modes of combination.

recognise in it clearly the coexistence of the two rituals
which I have described seriatim.

what we know of ancient Roman practice in such matters.

We must make here, Ι think, some distinctions. At
the beginning and in the middle of this ceremony we
meet with prayers which are more Roman than Gallican

1111111116 of the basilica, the prayer Deus qm· loca, and the
eucharistic formulary Deus sanctificationum. It is pos-
sible that these were borrowed from the Roman Liturgy.¹
