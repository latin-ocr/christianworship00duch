resulted—as far as the day was concerned—in assigning the
2lst of March or the 13th or l9th of April for the day of
Christ’s death. The De Pascha Computus, previously re-
ferred to, gives the eth of April. Lactantius1 assigns it to
the 23rd of March, but a solution more generally accepted
makes it the 25th. Tertullian is the first to mention the
subject ; he says :—Passi0 perfecta est sub Tiberio Caesare,
consulibus Rubellio Gemino et Fufio Gemino [29], mense
martio, temporibus Paschae, dz'e vai. scal. april, die prima
azymommz.2 Hippolytus, in his Paschal Table, refers the
Passion of Christ to a year in which the l4th of Nisan
fell on Friday, the 25th of March. In his Commentary on
Daniel 3 he definitely assigns the Passion to Friday, the 25th
of March, in the consulate of the two Gemini. The Philo-
calian Catalogue of the Popes gives the same day and year.
It must be remembered that both the Cycle of Hippolytus
and the Philocalian Catalogue are based upon official docu-
ments‚ and that they may be regarded as indicating the
Roman ecclesiastical reckoning. This same date—the 25th of
March—appears also in certain Acts of Pilate, which, about
the beginning of the fourth century at latest, were widely
known, and enjoyed a considerable reputation. It was from
this document, which was well known throughout Asia
Minor, that the Quartodecimans of Phrygia obtained their
date of the 25th of March for Easter. In Cappadocia the
adherents of this sect were divided as to the fixing upon the
25th of March, or the 14th of Nisam, but they were at one
in refusing to celebrate Easter on a Sunday.4 In the fifth
and sixth centuries the traditional date of the 25th of March
was so firm]y established in Gaul, that it gave rise to not only

² Adv. Judaeos (written about 207), c. 8. These dates are irreconcilable
with each other. On the 25th of March, in the year 29, the moon was in
its last quarter. The Passover could not therefore fall on this day.
