THE ROMAN MAss. 169

ancient and most solemn representation of the Davidic
Psalter. We must take care not to put them on the same
footing as the other chants, the Introit, Offertory, and Com-
munion, which were introduced later, and then merely to
occupy attention during long ceremonies. The gradual
and similar chants had an intrinsic value, and during the
time in which they were sung there was nothing else
going on.1 This was the ancient chanting of the psalms‚
which in the primitive Church alternated with the lections
from Holy Scripture.2

The gyradual, as has been said, was so called because
it was sung at the mondus, or ambo, where the lections
also were read. It was sung always by a single cantor,
and the office of the choir was confined to taking up the
final musical phrase.3 The other chants were executed
‘in plano by the choir, or schola cantorum. It was also
customary, up to the time of St. Gregory, that the
gradual and its additions should be sung like the Grospel,
by deacons only3 and this function had quite a special
importance in the ministry of that order. Mention of it
frequently occurs in epitaphs:

“ Psallere et in populis volui modulante propheta
sic merui plebem Christi retinere sacerdos,'’

says a bishop, explaining in this manner how the faithful,

ending of the chant. This practice is very ancient, for mention is made
of it in the Apostolical Gonstitutions .- “Τὶς τοὺς τοῦ Δαβὶδ ψαλλέτω ὕμνους
καὶ ὁ λαὸς τὰ ἀκροστίκια ὑποψαλλέτω ” (ii. 57). Cf. above, pp. 113, 114.
