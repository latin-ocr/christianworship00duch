imposition of the sign of the cross, and, from this point of
view, it corresponds with the Roman ceremony of the signing
with the cross in the ritual of the catechumenate.

At Milan, the anointing and the Effeta were relegated,
as at Rome, to Easter Eve.1 This difference in the order
of the ceremonies appears to go back to a considerable
antiquity. It was a subject of discussion about the year
400, for we see in a document of that period2 that the
bishops of Gaul had consulted the Pope on the matter. At
Rome, provided the unction took place after the third
scrutiny, the day was not considered of any moment. We
see that on this point the Church of Milan conformed her
use to that of Rome, but in Spain it was otherwise. We
have no documentary evidence to show which course was

adopted in Gmflss

¹ There are. however, differences, for at Rome the Effeta and the
renunciation of the devil took place in the morning, at a service quite
distinct from the actual baptism, while at Milan these ceremonies occurred
immediately before the neophyte entered the font. Moreover‚ the Effeta
at Milan was made with consecrated oil‚ and not with saliva.

³ In the Mis-sale Gothicum, the ritual of the catechumenate, under the
rubric Aa Christianum faciendum, is placed on Easter Eve. In the Missale
Gallicanum, it is true, this ritual precedes the Traditio Symboli ; but there
is, at that place, a lacuna which prevents us from ascertaining whether the
unction occurred there or not. Its use is not indicated on Easter Eve.
I give here two formularies for this ceremony, the first of which figures
in the Missale Gothicum ; the other, which is still in use, is common 130 the
Gelasian Sacramentary (cf. supra, p. 295) and to that of Bobbio.

Siqno te in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus saneti, ut sis christianus:
oculos, ut videas claritatem Dei ; aures, at audias vocem Domini ‚· nares, ut
oclores suavitatem Christi conversus, ut confitearis Patrem et Filium et
Spiritum sanctum ,· eor, ut eredas Trinitatem inseparabilem. Pax tecum.

Accipe signum crucis, tam in fronte quam in corde ,· sume fidem caelestium
praeceptorum ,· talis esto moribus ut templum Dei esse jam possis ; inqres-
susque Ecclesiam Dei evasisse te laqueos mortis laetus agnosce. Horresce
idola, respue simulacra, cole Deam Patrem omnipotentem et Jessum Christum
Filium ejus qai vivit cum Patre et Spiritu sancto per omnia saecula
saeculorum.

Then follows, in the Gelasian Sacramentary, the prayer Te deprecor,
still in use (for adulte), and another prayer, Deus qui es et qui eras, etc.
