persecution.1 It was also observed in the countries following
the Gallican rite. Ammianus Marcellinus2 relates that, in
361, Julian, who was already ill—disposed towards Con-
stantius, but who continued to disguise his pagan leanings,
was publicly present at the Christian religious service in
Vienne on the day of the Epiphany, seriarum die quem cele-
brantes mense januario christiani Epiphania dictitant. The
Council of Saragossa (380) mentions it also (c. 4) as a

Α1 Rome and in Africa the festival of the 6111 of January
was as little known as that of the 25th of December among
the Orientals.4 The Epiphany does not occur in the Philo-
calian Calendar, and the Donatists did not keep it. St.
Augustine reproaches them with this in terms which imply
that the festival had been imported from the East, quia neo
unitatem amant, nec orientali eeclesiae . . . communicant.⁵
The two festivals were accepted everywhere in the West
from the beginning of the fifth century, except among the
Donatists.

It is thus clear that towards the end of the third century
the custom of celebrating the anniversary of the birth of
Christ had spread throughout the whole Church, but that
it was not observed everywhere on the same day. In the
West the 25th of December was chosen, and in the East
the 6111 of January. The two customs, distinct from each
other at first, came finally to be combined so that the two
festivals were universally observed, or almost so.

³ “A xvi. kal. jan. usque in diem Epiphaniae qui est viii. id. jan.
continuis diebus, nulli liceat de ecclesia absentare.’' Is the festival of the
25th of December had been observed in Spain at this date, it ought,
apparently, to have been mentioned in this canon.
