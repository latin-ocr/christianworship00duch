10 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

is manifested beyond the limits of Palestine: at Antiooh in
Pisidia there are several “rulers of the synagogue 3 '' at
Corinth, a single one.l This diversity in J ewish customs
may possibly have contributed to produce that looseness in
the use of terms, or in the actual differences, which meet us
in the earliest Christian documents when they come to speak
of the hierarohy of their newly founded Churohes² The real
differences may have been very great3 the primitive Churches
were not all influenced to the same extent by the Christian
social ideal. At Jerusalem they went so far as to recognise
the community of possessions3 but as a general rule they
stopped a long way short of this.

The institution of the Seven, in the same Churoh, served
later on as a support for the tradition that the number of
deacons should not exceed that figure. In other Ohurches,
where the duties to be performed were of a less complex
nature, the number of the officials as far as serving brethren
were concerned, was more restricted. There was a similar
class of persons employed in the synagogue3 they are
designated in the Gospel simply as ὑπηρέται (servitors).

In short, whether from imitation of the synagogim, or
simply from the exigencies common to any community, the
first Christians soon appeared equipped with a hierarchy of
three grades. This hierarchy derived its powers directly or
indirectly from the apostles themselves As a rule, the
community chose the individual‚ but the investiture was .
made either by the local bishop, or, when this office itself
was in question, by the superior ecelesiastica] authority
representing the succession of the apostles.
