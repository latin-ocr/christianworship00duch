(Extract from the Pereyrinatio of Etheria (Silvia).)

THE following are the final pages of a curicus book discovered by Signor
Ι. F. Gramurrini in a MS. at Arezzo, and published by him in the Biblioteca
deZZ'Accademia storico yiuridica, vol. iv„ Rome, 1887, and in the studi e
documenti di storia e diruto, April to Sept.‚ 1888. It is the account of a
long pilgrimage to the holy places in the East, undertaken by a great lady
who addresses it to her “ sisters‚'’ that is to say, probably sisters in the
religious profession. Her journey seems to have taken place in the time
of Theodosius, and some important indications inclined Signor Gramur-
rini to identify her with Silvia, the sister of the celebrated minister Rufinus.
This identification was not accepted as certain by any one, but was
generally adopted for convenience of quotation. The real name of the
pilgrim has been discovered by Dom M. Ferotin (Revue des questions
historiques, vol. lxxiv. [October‚ 1903] p. 367, et seq.) She was a virgin
called Etheria,1 of the province of Galicia [Spain]. Valerius, a monk of this
same country, who lived in the seventh century, has left us a life of this
lady in a letter addressed to the Religious of Vierzo‚ in which the Pere-
9rinatio is described at length. This short epistle has been known for
some time (Florez, Espafna sermacia, vol. xvi. p. 366 3 Migne, Pae. Lat„ vol.
lxxxvii. p. 421), but no one had thought of it in connection with the text
discovered by Signor Gamurrini. Dom Ferotin has published an edition
of it (op. cit„ p. 379), revised from the original MSS. Henceforward‚
assigned to its real author, it must be cited as the Pereyrinatio Etheriae.

Several editions have appeared 2 since Signor Gamurrini's first. I have
revised the text, which I took in the first instance from that editor, making
special use of the edition by M. Paul Geyer, [tm. Hierosol. SaecJHL-
VHI.‚vol. xxxix. of the Vienna Corpus SS. Eccles. Latin„ pp. 71—101, in
which his own corrections and conjectures, as well as those of preceding
writers on the subject, may be found. I have accepted only a certain
number of these corrections. It appeared to me more prudent to leave
Etheria's style and grammar untouched. Her Latin is not classical,
and will always be difficult to accommodate to grammatica] rules. The
main point is to understand it, and it is, I think, generally easy to do so.

I have not thought it necessary to annotate the text. I add, however,
a few explanations as to the ecclesiastieal topography of Jerusalem and
