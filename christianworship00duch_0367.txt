 

CEREMONIES or CHRISTIAN INITIATION. 341

always the chrismatio, and not the imposition of hands, that is mentioned
in the texts. As to the Eastern Chureh, St. Gregory’s phrase entirely
agrees with the rule laid down by the seventh canon of Constantinople;
but all the same, the liturgical books expressly mention the imposition of
hands when it is a question of dealing with heretice. On the other hand,
they do not mention it in connection with ordinary confirmation, although
writers like Ohrysostom, Theodoret‚ Gennadius, and Photins, when they

comment on the text Heb„ vi. 1, never fail to speak expressly of it. Indeed,
the author of the Apostolic Constitutions viii. 28, desiring to enunciate the
theory that a priest has the power to confirm, but not to ordain, thus
expresses himself: ‘⁶ Πρεσβύτερος . . . χειροθετεῖ οὐ χειροτονεΐ.” He also calls
(iii. 15> the ceremony in which the bishop applies the perfumed unguents

after baptism imposition of hands (χειροθεσία). We must therefore be
somewhat cautious here in dealing with isolated expressions, and in every
case consider the thing itself rather than the term used to denote it.
