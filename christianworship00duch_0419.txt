are represented, we observe a striking resemblance between
the two. To be convinced of this, it is merely necessary
to glauce at the mosaic which I have just mentioned, or
at the miniatures of the Tivoli cartularium. In the latter
we see grouped together the Pope, with his pallium over
his planeta, and the suburbicarian bishops, with their
stoles under the same vestment. Both stoles and pallium
are of exactly the same shape and colour, and are orna—
mented with the same little black crosses. It is there-
fore quite conceivable that whoever wore one of these
two insignia might not wear the other.l

In the end, however, a combination of the two was
effected. At Ravenna, where a love for decorations was
always evinced, we see in the mosaics of San Vitale, Bishop
Ecclesius (sixth century) wearing both the priestly stole
and the Roman pallium. This picture seems to 106 611
isolated instance,2 the other Bishops of Ravenna, successors
of Ecclesius‚ being represented with >the pallium only.
Both are seen worn together in a Sacramentary of the ninth
century3 from Autun‚ and 011 the paliotto [altar covering] of
San Ambrogio of Milan3 and such appears to have been the
custom thenceforward among the F rankish clergy.

If we take these facts into consideration, and also the
differences and modifications‚ we are thus led to trace the

history of the insignia known under the names pallium,
omophorion, 0161111111, stole⁷ and epitrachelion, All have a

common origin. They are distinguishing marks of dignity,
introduced into ecclesiastical use during the fourth century,

¹ Cf. the painting in San Clemente (De Rossi. Ball„ 1865, p. 2) repre-
senting Pope Nicholas translating the 1611161115 of St. Clement. The Pope
wears the pallium, but no stole. St. Methodius and another bishop, who
are assisting at the ceremony, have the stole, but not the pallium. The
painting is of the twelfth century.

² It should be ascertained whether this is a restoration or not.
