are attributed to him, and not a systematic and official
collection.1 This, however, proved sufficient to give rise
to the idea that Gelasius had put forth a Sacramentary.
On the arrival of Pope Adrian's missive, the Franks had
found themselves face to face with a Sacramentary attri-
buted to St. Gregory, and differing from that which they
had known hitherto. Thenceforward the latter could be
as none other than that of Gelasius, and this idea having
once taken hold of the minds of teachers like Alcuin and
others, it was inevitable that it should spread widely and
rapidly. Among the branches of study over which these
learned men presided‚ there were few of greater importance
and of more practical application than that of the Liturgy.
The Gelasian Sacramentary became a subject of teaching
in the schools, and its position thenceforward was im-
pregnable.2

In our opinion, no weight can be attached to this
designation. By the term Gelasian Sacramentary we
must understand a Roman liturgical collection introduced
into France some time before Adrian, and certainly sub-
sequently to St. Gregory. This conjecture as to the date

1 “ Fecit etiam et sacramentorum praefationes et orationes cauto sermone ”
(Liber Pont, vol. i. p. 235). In some copies of the De Scriptoribus of
Gennadius, we find a notice of Gelasius, in which he is said to have
written afterwards, “tractatas diversarum scripturarum et saoramentorum”
(Ibid., p. 257).

2 This explanation is a pure hypothesis. But in spite of its not
having been accepted by all those who arc concerned with the subject,
no better one has as yet been put forward. It has been suggested that
the Roman Sacramentary might have been introduced into Gaul by St.
Caesarius, under the name of Gelasius, but this is quite inadmissible.
St. Caesarius as is seen by his Homilies, never used any except the
Gallican Liturgy. Wilson (op. cit„ p. lxi.) properly remarks, that if Alcuin,
or whoever the compiler of the supplements to the Gregorian Sacramentary
may have been (supra, p. 121), had found the name of Gelasius in the
Gelasian sacramentam, he could hardly have refrained from using it to

authenticate his additions.
