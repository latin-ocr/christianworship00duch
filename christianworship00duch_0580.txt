4. The Presenz‘ation (l4th February).

⁷Without doubt the fortieth day after the Epiphany is cele-
brated here, with the very highest honour, for on that day there
is a procession, in which all take part, in the Anastasis, and all

Easter. All the Priests preach, and then the Bishop, always
taking for their subject that part of the Gospel where Joseph
ancl Mary brought the Lord into the Temple on the fortieth day,

that one day, there is never fasting on any Sabbath here through-
out the year. Thus, declucting the eight Lord's Days and the
seven Sabbaths (for on the one sabbath, as I said above, the fast
is obligatory) from the eight weekS, there remain forty-one fast

Now the several days of the several weeks are kept thus τ

in the Anastasis the account of the Lord's Resurrection from the
Gospel‚ as on all Lord's Days throughout the whole year, and
everything is done at the Anastasis and at the Cross as on all
Lord’s Days throughout the year, up to daybreak. Afterwards,
