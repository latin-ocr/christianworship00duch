CHAPTER X.

ORDINATION.

ξ 1.--ΤΗΕ ECCLESIASTICAL HiERARGHY.

THE ecclesiastical hierarchy, in its earliest stage, comprised,
as we have seen above, three orders, those of the episcopate‚
the priesthood, and the diaconate. The functions of the
first two orders could be exercised by men only, but
women had been admitted, to a certain extent, to share
the duties of the diaconal ministry. Beside the deacons
of the male sex, the ancient Church recognised deaconesses,1
who also bore the name of Widows, χῆραι, viduae, or even

¹ The following inscription, discovered in the cemetery of Priscilla, is
perhaps the most ancient Christian inscription which mentions a member
of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. It is the epitaph of a deaconess (χήρα) :-—

ΦλάβιΑ “ APKAC ‘ XHPA ' HT C

ἔζησεΝ · AITH · ΠΕ · MHTPI ·

ὙλυκυΤΑΤΗ ” ΦΛάΒῙΑ · ΘΕΟΦῙΛΑ
θυγάτΗΡ ἐπΟΙΙ-ΙΕΕΝ.

“Flavia Arcas, widow, who lived eighty-five years. Το her beloved mother
Flavia Theophila, her daughter, has made (this tomb).” It is hardly
possible that this person was an ordinary widow. At eighty—five years of
age widowhood is not so unusual a state as to require special mention
of it on an epitaph (De Rossi, Ball„ 1886, p. 90; cf. Ball. Oritique, vol. viii.
p. 255).
