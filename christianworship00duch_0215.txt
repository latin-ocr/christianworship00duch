still almost unknown in Gaul, while it was already in use
at Rome and “in Italy,'' that is, at Milan.

After the Kyrie came the ‘⁶ Prophecy,''1 that is, the
canticle Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel (Luke i. 68-79).
In the Mozarabic Liturgy it is still ordered to be sung
once every year, that is, on the Sunday in adventu S.

,Iohannis Baptistae. It has disappeared completely from
the Ambrosian Liturgy.2

The Trisagion and the Prophecy were not used during
Lent, at least at Paris, but a special oanticle, which
began with the words Sanetus Deus Arcltanyelorum‚ was
substituted for them.3

After the Prophecy the bishop said a prayer, which
had either some analogy with the canticle itself or a
bearing upon the festival of the day. This is what is
called the C‘ollectio post Prophetiam. The following is the
text of it, taken from the Missale Gothicum for the festival
of the Nativity :—

Ortus es nobis, verus Sol justitiae, Jesu Ohriste3 venisti de caelo

¹ Mabillon, and many others after him, have confounded the “Pro-
phecy’' with 13116 Prophetic Lection. It is evident that it is 10 1116 first,
that is, to the Canticle of 1116 Bencclictm, that Gregory of Tours is
referring in Hz'st. Frcmc„ viii. 7, where Palladius, Bishop of Saintes, is
introduced as beginning the chanting of the Prophecy: “Quo incipiente
prophetiam. . . .’' The officiating bishop precented the canticles‚ but
he did not read the lections; that was the business of the lectors or
deacons.

² It had a place there originally, to judge from the Sacramentary
of Bobbio, in which the rubrio Collectio post Prophetiam occurs several
times.

³ Germain, Ep. ii.: ‘⁴ Sanctus Deus Arclzcmqelorum in Quadragesimo
concinitur et non canticum Zachariae. . . . Nec Alleluia in nostra 66-
616616, Sanctus, vel prophetia, hymnus trium puerorum, vel canticum
Rubri maris illis diebus decantantur-P I think we ought to understand
Sanctus here as meaning the Trisagion. There was a previous refer-
ence to a canticle Scmctus cle Caelis, which was rcsumed at Easter,
with the song of Moses and the Alleluia, after having been omitted during
Lent.
