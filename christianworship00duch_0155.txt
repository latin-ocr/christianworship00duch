BooKs OF THE LATIN RITE. 133

orders being found in another place, but, by an oversight‚
at the end of the formularies relating to the subdeacons,
the compiler has left a fragment of the rite for the ordi-
nation of priests.

These interpolations are not isolated instances, as Ι shall
soon have occasion to point out.

In the arrangement of the various festivals, there are often
discrepancies between the Gelasian and Gregorian Sacra—
mentaries. The former inserts certain festivals which the
latter omits, and vice versa. Now, it must be remarked that
in these divergencies the Gregorian has the support of the
Leonian Sacramentary‚ of which I shall speak later on;
that is to say, it has on its side a purely Roman com-
pilation, free from any Frankish or Gallican influence. The
Leonian never mentions any festival characteristic of the
Gelasian Sacramentary. On the contrary, it contains several
festivals peculiar to the Gregorian, namely, those of the
Seven Brothers (July 10), St. Stephen, the Pope (August 2),
SS. Felicissimus and Agapitus (August 6), SS. Felix and
Adauctus (August 30), and S. Chrysogonus (November 24).
It inserts, moreover, although out of its proper place, the
anniversary of St. Silvester, a festival unknown to the
Gelasian Calendar‚ and finally, as in the Gregorian Sacra-
mentary, it places the Feast of St. Euphemia on September
16, whereas the Gelasian assigns it to April 13.l This last
divergence‚ which is also met with in the Hieronymian
Martyrology and in the Mozarabic Missal, may well have
been suggested by the Gallican use. The same may be said
of the festivals of the Invention of the True Cross and the
Martyrdom of St. John Baptista, which are inserted in the
Gallican liturgical books, but for which no Roman docu-
ment can be cited as an authority. I would also point out

¹ This is also the day on which this festival is marked in the Calendar
of Carthage and in all the Greek oalendars.
