which he believed it necessary to make. He has prefaoed
the latter with an explanatory note and a list of the fresh
material added. Hence, there 660 106 00 difficulty in
distinguishing in the Gregorian manuscripts1 those portions
which represent the copy sent by Adrian to Charle-
magne.²

The Gregorian Sacramentary comprisedz—lst‚ the Ordi-
nary of the Mass3 2nd, the Prayers, Prefaees, and other
variable parts of the Mass, recited or chanted by the bishop
or officiating priest, on festival and 6136110061 days. This
series embraoes the entire course of the eeclesiastioal year,
beginning with Christmas Eve. 3rd, Prayers at the ordination
of deaoons, priests, and bishops These three parts do not

tion prayers are at the beginning, in others they are inserted

² This may be seen from M. Delisle’s descriptions on pp. 96, 124, 141.
143, 150, 151, 171, 616. In Muratori's edition, a provoking transposition of
the text has here been the cause of some confusion; pp. 139-240, which
evidently belong to the supplement, ought to follow on after p. 272, where
we find the end of the Liber sacramentorum sent by Adrian, and, immediately
after, the prefaoe to the supplement.

² For the references to 1116 text of the Gregorian Sacramentary I
make use (for want of a better) of Muratori's edition. Liturqz'a Romana
vetus, vol. ii. In his notes on the Book of Cerne (the Prayer Book of
Aedelwald the Bishop, commonly called “The Book of Cerne,'' ed. by
Dom A. B. Kuypers, Cambridge, 1902), p. 5 of the separate part, Mr.
Edmund Bishop considers it evident that in my opinion the Sacramentary
of Adrian is exclusively represented by pp. 1-138 of Muratori's edition,
while, in his opinion, pp. 241-272 and 357-361 should also be included.
Pages 357-361 contain the forms of ordination for bishops, priests, and
deaoons, and it will be seen above, as also in preceding editions of the present
work, that I have mentioned these formularies as oonstituting part of the
Sacramentary in question. As far as this point, therefore, is conosi-ned, Mr.
Bishop's 6111161601 16 without foundation. As to pp. 241-272‚ I willingly
admit with him that they should be added to pp. 1-138, and that they were
only separated from them by a mistake in the arrangement of the pages.
Even then, with this addition, the Saoramentary is still a very incomplete
book, and I adhere to my belief that, taken by itself‚ it does not represent
the entire collection of liturgica] formularies in use at Rome during the
eighth century. s
