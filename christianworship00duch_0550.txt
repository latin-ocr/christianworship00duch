’ THE: CANONs OF HIPPOLYTUS.

Tmz “ Canens of Hippolytus '’ are not known to us in the original Greek
text, but only through Arabio and Ethiopic translations of a Coptic
version of the Greek original. Moreover, these translations have reached
us only in manuscripts of the thirteenth century at earliest. The late
Mgr Haneberg, Bishop of Spires, prepared the Latin version, which I
give here. We see thus that there are several intermediaries between us
and the original text. There is reason to believe also that, apart from
accidents of transcription and translation, we have more than one instance
of interpolation. Taken as a whole, however, this collection of liturgica]
and disciplinary prescriptions belongs certainly to a date anterior to the
fourth century, and there is nothing to hinder us from assigning it to the
time of Hippolytus himself.

Ι have thought it well to reproduoe the text here, although it has been
twice published, once by Haneberg, in 1870, and again by Herr Achelis,
in 1891.1 Too much attention cannot be given to such an important
document. In the learned treatise which Achelis has prefixed to his
edition, he has discussed the majority of the questions which the Canens
of Hippolytus have raised, but there is still much to be done.

Herr Achelis has re-edited Haneberg’s version, omitting a long homi-
letica] passage, Which was evidently interpolated, and changing the order
of the chapters. These are not arbitrary modificationS‚ but are based on
an ancient recension of the Canens of Hippolytus in the Canens Eccle-
siasticczl of Egypt, of which we possess a Coptic version.2 The latter text,
which is prior to the Apostolic Constitutions, so long known to the world,
that is, from the end of the fourth century, implies a recension of the Canens
