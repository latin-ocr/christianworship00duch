272 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

Virgin* Its date results from that assigned to the birth of
Christ, which it must follow at an interval of forty days.
The first notice we have of its institution is in the second

half of the fourth century, and that too in Jerusalem. The
Pereyrinatz'o of Etheria (Silvia) describes it under the name

Quacbuyesimae de Epiphania. As the festival of Christmas
had not yet been adopted there, the Presentation was celebrated
on the fortieth day after the Epiphany, that is, on the 141212
of F ebruary.1 In the description of the festival furnished by
Etheria, we remark no indication of a special association with
the Blessed Virgin. An edict of Justinian, of the date 542?
enjoins the solemnisation of this festival at Constantinople.

The observance of the festival of the Annunciation‚ on the
25th of March, is attested by the chronicon Paschale (first
half of the seventh century), which speaks of it (ad ann.
5506) as an established institution.3 Like the preceding
festival, this is also dependent on that of ChristmaS.

About the time of the Council in Trullo (692), which
mentions all four festivals, a document at Rome attested,
not only to the observance of the two preceding festivals,
but also to two other commemorations of the Blessed Virgin,
viz. that of her Nativity (8th September), and that of her
Dormitio (15th August).4 These four festivals are recorded
in the Gelasian Sacramentary at the beginning of the eighth
century. They had passed, therefore, into Roman usage as
early as the seventh century.⁵ I am unable to say, or even

festival, will be found on p. &tc—Ta]

Calendar.

that Andreas of Crete delivered his homilies on the Nativity, Annuneiaffion,

Gregory. Not only does he never make mention of them, but the same
