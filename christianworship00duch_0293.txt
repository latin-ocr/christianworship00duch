THE CHRISTIAN FESTIVALS. 269

3. The Festivals of the Viryin and of St. John Bapaeist.

We have seen that the Armenian Calendar provides in
the last days of December for a special festival in honour of
the two relatives of Christ, King David, and James, “the
brother of the Lord.'' The person who has in this respect
an incontestable right to a special commemoration among
the festivals of the Nativity is assuredly the Blessed Virgin.
We need not, therefore, be astonished that her festival finds a
place immediately after Christmas in the Ν estorian Calendar.
A similar festival appears also in the Coptic Calendar on the
lssth of J anuary, almost immediately after the solemnities
of the Epiphany, which came to an end on the 14th.

In Gaul also we find, in the sixth century, a festival
of the Blessed Virgin in the month of January: mediante
mense umlecz'mo, says Gregory of Tours.l The H ieronymian
Martyrology, in its revised Auxerre form (circ. 595), assigns
this festival to the 18th of January.2 It appears also
in the liturgical books in this part of the calendar, but with
somewhat less precision.

Her festival was celebrated in Spain, but at various
dates in various places. The tenth Counoil of Toledo (656)
enjoins a fixed and universal date, the 18th of December,

eight days before Christmas.3

(Greg. Turn, Hist. Fr„ x. 31).

² In the Luxeuil Lectionary it follows the 2nd Sunday after Epiphany,
before the festival of cathedra Petri, which was then celebrated 011 the
18th of January. In the Missale Gothicum it occurs between Epiphany
and St. Agnes (21st January); in the Sacramentary of Bobbio, between
Epiphany and Lent, with (and after) the festival of the Chair of St. Peter.
The Hieronymian Martyrology gives the two festivals on the same day.

³ Can. 1. From the terms employed by the council it has been wrongly
inferred that it was cognisant of the festival of the 25th of March as in vogue
in certain Ghurches. This was not the case. The council confined itself
