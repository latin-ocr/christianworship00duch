ORDINATION. 377

ceremonies given in Dionysius are fundamentally the same,
but there are some more precise details, For instance, the
deacon kneels on only one knee during the reciting 01
the consecrating prayer. After this prayer, the officiating
minister signs the forehead of the newly ordained with
the sign 01 13110 01055, and announces solemnly his name.

We see that in all these rites the ceremony 01
ordination consists especially of a prayer recited over
the candidate in a public and solemn assembly. This
prayer is accompanied by the imposition of hands.1 In
this general form the ritual is that which we find in the
N ew Testament.2 We see, moreover‚ that the choice 01
the rulers and ministers of the Ohurch was from the
beginning reserved to the apostles or to their repre-
sentatives. This authority came naturally to be passed
on to the bishops, their successors and continuers 01 their
work, as far as the rule 01 13110 local Christian communities
was concerned. As for the installation of the bishops
themselves, it was considered indispensable that it should
be entrusted to a more exalted authority than the individual
bishop. This authority could be no other than the superior
jurisdiction of the Church, that is, the collective episcopal
hierarchy. As it was impossible to bring together at each
ordination all the members of this hierarchy‚ it was arranged
that it should be represented by a group of neighbouring
bishops, or, in certain places, by the metropolitan bishop.

¹ It is worth while citing here the words of St. Augustino: “Quid
aliud est manuum impositio quam oratio super hominem?'’ This obser-
vation is so true that the imposition of hands in express terms is frequently
omitted in the books of ritual. It was considered to be implied in the
oratio super hominem. It is necessary also to note that in almost all the
known formularies of prayer the degree to which the candidate is pro-
moted 15 mentioned. I say “almost all‚'⁷ for this indication 15 not found
in the prayer for the ordination of a priest in the Euchologion of Sarapion.
