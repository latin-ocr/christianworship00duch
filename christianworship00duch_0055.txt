extreme importance to the decisions pronounced by this
fllustrious see. In 393, the General African Oouncil, held
at Hippo, thought it advisable to withdraw the prohibition
which prevented their clergy from ministering to the
Donatists who had received in infancy schismatic baptism.
But as this involved the infringement of a general law
of the Church, it was thought necessary first to consuit

brought up again in another general councii held at Carthage

The replies sent from Rome and Milan were unfavourable3
but after the death of Siricius and Simplicianus the Africans

successors. The General Council of June, 401, sent as a
deputy to the latter a bishop charged to explain to them the
desirability of the concession demanded.

but the personal merits of that great bishop are not
sufficient to account for this attitude of the Latin episcopate
towards the see of Milan. There was no lack in the West
at that moment of prelates renowned for their zeal, sanctity‚
