THE DEDIGATION OF GHUROHES. 407

The Ordo of Verona mentions the aspersion of the church
at the end of the ceremony, but this passage is suspected to
be an interpolation. In any case there is nothing like it
in the other Ordo ; even in that 01 Verona the aspersion
is a mere afterthought added to the ceremony of the
depositio}

There would be, indeed, nothing extraordinary in the
fact 11 11 had been customary to asperse the walls of a new
edifice. As early as the time of Pope Vigilius the faithful
at Rome were in the habit 01 sprinkling holy water in their
houses. The Liber Pontificalis testifies to the practice.2
From the existing authorities, however, we cannot, Ι believe,
conclude that this custom had been then, or even 101 0
long time, extended to edifices consecrated 101 worship.

Having reconstructed‚ at least in its main outlines,
1110 Roman ritual for the dedication of 0110101103, 1 will
endeavour 10 do the same in regard 10 the Gallican usage.3
It is no easy task, 101 110 description has come down to
us, and no liturgical text, if we do not take into account

¹ As the Ordo of Verona has no reference elsewhere 10 1110 aspersion
of the people with the remains 01 1110 exorcised water, before the door of
the church, it 13 possible that it may here have that in view. The people
and not the walls, are aspersed, and this in the interior instead 01 1110
exterior. In the other rituals, that which remains of the lustral water is
simply poured out at the foot of the altar. It would appear that some
importance was attached 10 113 disappearance, probably 10 prevent its being
used for some superstitious purpose.
