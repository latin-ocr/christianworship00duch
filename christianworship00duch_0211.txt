THE GALLICAN MASS.

THE Gallican use having almost entirely disappeared‚ it would
be difficult to picture to ourselves from experience the ancient
ceremonies of a solemn Mass in the Churches of this rite.
Fortunately‚ St. Germain of Paris († 576) has left us a
sufficiently clear account of it, and one much more ancient
than that afforded by the Roman Ordines. I will restrict
my description of it, therefore, to that given by this venerable
author, and in reproducing his text1 will compare it with
other documentary sources for reconstructing the Gallican
use—that is, the Mozarabic Missal, the liturgical books
of Merovingian Gaul, of Britain, and of North Italy. As
the Gallican texts are less known and less accessible than
the Roman, I have thought it necessary to introduce in
my description all the formularies for prayers and chants
which the Gallican Mass contained. With this purpose
in view, Ι have selected those for the festival of the
Nativity, and Ι take the text from the Missale Gothicum.

¹ In this reproduction I restrict myself to the sentences or parts of
a sentence in which the rite is described. As for the symbolical signi-
fication of the rites, as they do not enter directly into my aima, Ι refer
the reader to Martene's edition (Thesaurus, vol. v.; Migne, Pat. Lat„
vol. lxxii). Here and there Ι venture to correct the most glaring errors
of the copyist.
