the festivals of Easter and Epiphany, it lasted eight
days. From Jerusalem it passed to Constantinople‚ and
at length to Rome, where it was introduced as late as
the seventh century.1

The Gallican Churches, to which this festival was un-
known, had another of the same significance, at least in
regard to the discovery of the true cross. They celebrated
it on the 3rd of May. It is found on this date in
several early manuscripts of the Hieronymian Martyr-
ology.2 In the two Gallican Sacramentaries of Autun
(Missale Gothicum) and Bobbio respectively it appears
between the octave of Easter and the Rogation days,
without a more precise indication of date. In the
Gelasian Sacramentary 113 16 11016(1 011 the 3rd of May,

Pope Adrian—-its presence here may be attributed 130 6
Gallican revision of this text. It seems even to have
been introduced into Gaul somewhat late, that is, in the

sanctarum encaenia cum summo honore celebrantur, quoniam crux Domini
inventa est ipsa die. Et ideo propter hoc ita ordinatum est, ut quando
primum sanctae ecclesiae suprascriptae consecrabantur, ea dies esset qua
crux Domini fuerat inventa, 61 simul omni laetitia eadem die celebrarentur.
Et hoc per Scripturas sanctas invenitur quod ea dies sit encaeniarum qua
et sanctus Salomon consummata domo Dei quam aedificaverat, steterit
ante altarium Dei et oraverit, sicut scriptum est in libris Paralipomenon
(Peregrinatio, infra, pp. 522, 576).

(Ρανίεὶηαε, 10837) of the beginning of the eighth century there is no
mention of this festival. It is also lacking in the Luxeuil Lectionary,
and Gregory of Tours does not mention it either, in a passage (ΘΖ. Mart„ 5)
where we might expect to find 6 notice of it.
