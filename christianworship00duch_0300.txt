The only angel of whom We find a commemoration
before the ninth century is St. Michael. Festivals of
this kind can be attributed only to the dedications of
churches. This was the case, in fact, with the Byzantine
festival of the 8th of November, relative to the Church of
St. Michael in the baths of Arcadius 3 2 also with the festival
of the 8th of May, relative to the celebrated sanctuary
of Monte Gargano, and with that of the 29th of September,
relative to a church (destroyed long ago) in the suburbs of
Rome at the sixth milestone on the Via Salaria. This
festival of St. Michael is the only one of the kind Which
appears in the early Roman liturgical books. It is found
in an authority as early as the Leonian Sacramentary, that
is, of the sixth century. The Gallican books and calendars
make no mention of a day especially assigned to the
commemoration of St. Michael the archangel.

The festival of the Maccabees (August 1) seems to have
been universally observed in the Church about the fifth
century. It is mentioned in all the calendars, beginning
with the most ancient form of the Hieronymian Martyrology.3
It does not occur, however, in any cf the Gallican or Roman
liturgical books, except the Gelasian Sacramentary. The
commemoration of the Maccabees, occurring, as it does, in
the kalends of August, must have been eclipsed by the
festival of St. Peter a vinculis.
