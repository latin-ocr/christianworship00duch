AUTHOR’s PREFAOE, v

annals and councils of Merovingian times make

such frequent reference, deserves a prominent place
among the venerable monuments of our ecclesiastical

antiquities. I think Ihave been able to add some
fresh observations to the conclusions of Mabillon and

Martene, particularly in that which concerns the

It is, however, specially to the Roman Liturgy that
I have directed my researches. Its history is clearly
more interesting to us than that of any other, since

possible, to go back earlier than the fourth century,
Ι have, however, for the most part, confined myself to
a less remote chronological period. Attention might

ments anterior to the time of Constantine, but they are
isolated facts, and the documents are few, and rarely
explicit. In researches into this period, conjecture has

to play too large a part, and it is more profitable,
therefore, to concentrate attention on 6 somewhat

later date, where both trustworthy and abundant
material is forthcoming.

With regard to these primitive liturgica] forms, I
