THE cnarsriAN FESTIVALs. 233

Saturday. The ancient formularies of indiction, however,
which are given in the homilies of St. Leo, mention the fast
01 1116 Wednesdays and Fridays only. That of the Saturday
being merely a “superposition‚'' or prolongation 01 11161 01
1116 Friday, is not taken into account.1 The distinguishing
feature 01 the Saturday was the Solemn Vigil, which on this
day was always observed at St. Peter’s: Quarta &qitzar et seaeta
feria jejunemus ; sabbato autem ad beatum Petrum apostolum
pariter vigilemus. The Vigil was always followed by the
Mass in the early hours of the Sunslay.

The Ember-day 16616, which are met with in those
countries only which followed the Roman use, and which
even in Rome did not take their rise till the fifth century,
appear to me 10 be none other than the weekly fast, as
observed at the beginning, but made specially severe, as well
by 1116 1616111101] 01 1116 Wednesday‚ which had disappeared
early from 1116 weekly Roman use, as by the substitution of
a 1661 16612 101 1116 661111-1661 01 1116 ordinary Stations.
The choice 01 1116 weeks in which the fast was thus in-
creased in rigour was determined by the commencement
of the four seasons of the year. It is probable that from
the first institution 01 1116 Ε1111061 Days the Synaxes of the
Wednesdays and Fridays, or at all events those 01 1116
Wednesdays‚ were liturgical. This appears to me 10 be
suggested by the archaic arrangement of the Mass 101 the
Wednesday in Ember Week‚ in which the prophetie lection
was still preserved, although it had fallen into disuse in
most Masses in the course of the fifth century.

¹ The author of the Liber Pontfflcalis (vol. i. p. 141), 011 1116 contrary,
mentions this one only. The reason is that 116 16 dealing with it as a
matter of practice, and not like St. Leo, as 6 11161161 of tradition. The
Saturday fast was the most flevere, as no food could have been caten since
the Thursday night.

² There was a much greater difference in the strictness with which the
fast was observed than in the methods of fixing the fasting days themselves·
