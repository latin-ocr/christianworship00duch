4 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

a J ew in order to worship the god of the Jewish people.
On the other hand, the Greeks for some time past had
combined a respect for the externals of worship with the
greatest latitude of opinion as to their efficacy, and even as
to the nature of the gods. Philosophical speculation could
readily be pursued without abandoning the 1161101161 religion.
Such a state of things, however, was not very favourable, on
the whole, to the spread of Jewish belief among the true
Hellenic population. There is ground to think that the
,16111511 propaganda obtained its chief success in another
direction‚ namely, among those subject peoples without home
or country, who were legally incapable of citizenship, and for
whom union with 1116 Jewish community meant 6 step
upwards politically, while at the same time their initiation
into the worship of God meant a step upwards spiritually.

situation and maintained and safeguarded the privileges
granted to the Jews by the Macedonian rulers, This orga-
nisation was part of the political machinery‚ and they were
careful not 10 destroy it. They refrained‚ however, from
importing it into the West. There was no doubt a Jewish
colony in Rome, and that at a fairly early date ; but it had
no privileged position. More than once—under Tiberius in
A.D. 19, and under Claudius in A.D. 54-112 was broken up,
and its members driven out of Italy. Rome, moreover,
was at this period a semi-Greek city, and it was among its
Greek—speaking inhabitants that the Jews were to be found,
a fact which is evidenced by the exclusively Greek inscrip-
tions on their tombs. The Jews never translated the
Scriptures¹ into Latin. The infiux of their nation into the
West is posterior 10 1116 early ages of Christianity.
