CEREMomns or onmsrrAN INITIATION. 333

The anointing with unguents, the signing with the
cross‚ and the imposition of hands,1 were also ceremonies
of universal observance. The signing with the cross was
made with the same fragrant oil as that used for the
anointing itself. At Rome and at Alexandria2 the unction‚
or chrismatio, was separate from the consignation. It was
performed by a priest, whereas the signing with the
cross was reserved for the bishop. In the East, and in
Gallican countries, the signing took place at the same time
as the chrismatio, and was made by the bishop when present,
or by an ordinary priest in his absence. Another Romano-
Alexandrian peculiarity‚ unknown to the Oriental and
Gallican 11166, was the drink of milk and honey given 10
1116 neophytes after their first communion.

All these ceremonies were in use 61 1116 beginning of 1116
fourth century3 on this point there cannot be the slightest
doubt. They must, therefore, have been introduced before
the Church was free from persecution, and even before that
of Diocletian. It now remains 10 be 66611 how far we can
trace them back into the three preceding centuries.

¹ The Greek rituale do not actually mention the laying-on of hands,
but it 16 certain that 11 was originally connected with the prayer that
accompanies the signing of the cross, a prayer in which the Holy Spirit
is invoked. Cf. infra, p. 340, note 3. It also occurs in the Canons of
Hippolytus and in the Egyptian ritual mentioned on the opposite page,
note 2.

Presence in the initiated by signs similar to those mentioned on p. 48.
