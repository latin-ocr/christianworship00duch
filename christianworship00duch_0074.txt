later compositions, but it is on the whole outside the
main stream, outside the general line of development
both in respect of its ritual and style.

From these monuments of the primitive age we must
come down at once to the fourth century. It is about
the latter period that we encounter sufficiently numerous
examples of the liturgical uses which, completed and
varied later on, became eventually that which we see them
to-day. Between the two epochs we find only isolated
references, passing allusions, scattered among authors of the
most divers character. It must be admitted, moreover,
that peculiarities in ritual took a certain length of time
to become fixed and established. At the beginning the
procedure was almost identical everywhere3 Ι say almost,
for a complete identity of all the details cannot be
assumed, even in the Churches founded by the apostles.
It was not in accordance with the practice of early days
to attach to things of this nature that importance which
would sanction and fix them. Usages developed by slow
degrees into rites3 rites expanded into more and more
imposing and complicated ceremonies, and at the same time
a limitation was put upon the subject-matter of the prayers
and exhortatione. Custom had indicated to the celebrant
