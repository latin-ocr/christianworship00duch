erusscrcAL FORMULARIES AND 600116. 115

Flavian and Diodorus, who became later on Bishops of
Antioch and Tarsus respectively, some picus lay people
were accustomed to meet at night in the sanctuaries of
the martyrs to pass the time in chanting psalms with two
choirs. Bishop Leontius, who favoured the Arianising party,
regarded with distrust these meetings, which were held
without his sanction. He induced the friends of Flavian
and Diodorus to celebrate their pious vigils in the Churches
of the city. This circumstance contributed much to making
known this new method of psalmody‚ and it soon spread
rapidly. By the time of St. Basill it had already been 111-
troduced into the Cappadocian Caesarea. The pilgrim Etheria

(Silvia), in the time of Theodosius, makes mention of noc-
turnal meetings exactly like those of Antioch and Caesarea:

the antiphon there occupied a place alongside the ancient
responsive psalmody: Psalmi respondunzur (sic), similiter et
antiphonae. St. Ambrose adopted this practice in 387.2 It
appears to have taken a longer time to get introduced 111130
13116 Roman Church. A text, somewhat obscure in character,
it is true, of the Liber Pontificalisss refers this introduction
to the time of Pope Celestine (422-432).

In the form in which 113 was adopted at Rome, the
antiphon admitted the alternative singing of a complete
psalm. All the verses were chanted to the same melody,
but the melody varied for each psalm. Before beginning
the psalm proper, some musical phrases were first executed,
to which certain words, borrowed chiefly from the psalm

itself, were adapted. This was what is called the anthem
[anaema] It was doubtless performed as a solo by

a cantor, in order to give the tone for the following
psalmody. The psalm being ended, there was a repetition
of the anthem.
