THE DEDIGATION or CHURGHES. 405

We find a confirmation of this in comparing together
the two most ancient ordines of dedication according to the
Roman usage. The first has been hitherto unpublished,1
and the second was edited by F. Bianchini in vol. iii. of
his Anastasius, p. xlviii. The ceremony described in both
of them is fundamentally the same, the differences between
them arising from the fact that while one inserts the musical
portions and omits the prayers, the other does the reverse.
On the whole they supplement each other. Their titles are
significant. There is no mention of the dedication; the
translation of relics takes its place, and, in fact, almost
the whole ceremony is taken up with it. Apart from
these two rituals, we find in the Gelasian Sacramentary2 a
convocation formulary entitled Denunciatio cum reliqu-iae
ponendae sunt martyrum, which corresponds to the ceremony
in question. I will briefly describe it.

The bishop, accompanied by his clergy, proceeds to the
place where are the sanctuaria. The choir‚ having sung a
respond, the litany is said, followed by a prayer of the
bishop. The latter then places the relics3 on a paten on
Which a linen cloth was spread, and covers the whole with
a silk veil. The procession then sets out sor the church to
be consecrated. The relics are borne either by the bishop
himself or by a priest. During the progress of the procession
a psalm is chanted by the choir, and on approaching the
church the litany is begun.

The bishop consigns the relics to the hands of the priests,
and, accompanied by only two or three clergy, enters the
church. He begins with the exorcism of the water, having
