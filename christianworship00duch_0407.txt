LITURGICAL vnerENTS. 381

when the saint disembarked on the coast of Africa, after
his return from exile, the nobles spread out their planetas
over his head to shelter him from the rain which was
falling at the time. John, the deacon, in his Life of st.
Gregory, describes the costume of that Pope and his father
Gordianus from contemporary pictures3* both are dressed
alike, and each wears over the dalmatic a chestnut-coloured
planeta.

The under-tunic has become the albe, from which have
been derived, through various modifications, the canon’s
rochet and the surplice 3 both of these garments may be
worn by clerks of different orders. The planeta has
become the chasuble, now scarcely ever wornl except by
priests and bishopS. It was a costly garment, and the
inferior clergy gave up its use at an early date.

Beyond the limits of Rome, the liturgica] dress com-
prised much the same garments, namely, the albe (tunica
linea, alba, στιχάριου) and the planeta, called also casula
(chasuble) or amphibalum? and in Greek phelonion (φελόνιου).
The albe os the deacon, although not of the shape of the
dalmatic, which was peculiar to the Roman use, was,
however, of a more costly material than that worn by the
ordinary clerk. It was not confined to the waist by a
girdle, but fell straight from the shoulders,3

¹ In Lent and other penitential seasons, it is still worn by the deacons
and subdeacons.

² These two terme are met with for the first time to denote a liturgical
vestment in the treatise of St. Germain of Paris. At Rome, the w‘ord
planeta was used, but its origin is unknown. The term casula, or rather
casulis, appears there for the first time in the Life of Stephen II.
(Lib. Pon„ vol. i. p. 443, I. 18), and again under a very corrupt form
(quodsulis).

³ It is thus described by St. Germain of Paris; the Greek deacons have
always worn it in this manner.
