ORDINATION. 34²7

referred to. The series of their epitaphs begins as early
as the second century on monuments which are probably
anterior to Tertullian‚ who is the first writer to mention
them.1 In the fourth century this order was pre-eminently
the first of the ministry‚ and constituted a sort of proba-
tionary stage. Young clerics began their career in it, and
remained lectors until they had reached an adult age,
which was a necessary qualification for receiving superior
orders.2 Most of the ecclesiastical careers of which the
details are known to us began with the lectorate. Such
was the case with St. Felix of Nola, St. Eusebius of Vercelli‚
the father of Pope Damasus, the Popes Liberius and
Siricius, Messius Romulus the Deacon of Fiesole‚ St.
Epiphanius of Pavia, and many others.3 It need not
therefore excite surprise that this order was extremely

to St. Laurence, in 258. The decretals of Popes Siricius, Zosimus, and Gela-
sius (Jaffiff, 255, 339, 636), bearing on promotion in the ecclesiastical career,
do not speak of doorkeepers as a step to entering that calling. Gelasius,
who alone mentions this order, raises a distinction between it and the others,
by saying that a knowledge of letters is obligatory before entering orders,
and that without it, vix fortassis ostiarii (quis) possit implere ministerium.
The Liber Pont. contains (vol. i. pp. 164, 171) two enumeratione of the
ranks of the hierarchy; the order of doorkeepers figures only in the second:
the Constitutum Silvestri omits it five times out of seven in enumerations
of the same nature. I know of no Roman inscription which mentions this
office. It is met with in a law of 337 (cod. Theoti„ XVI„ xii. 24); see
also the Treves inscription, Le Blant, 292, and the letter of SS. Lupus
and Euphronius (Hardouin, concites, vol. ii. p. 791). The doorkeepers were
superseded at an early date at Rome by the mansionarii, a kind of sacristan
not in orders, who appear as early as the sixth century.

Rossi, Bulz„ 1871, p. 32 ; Tertullian, Praescr„ 41.

² See the decretals cited above, p. 346, note 3. Those who entered the
ranks of the olergy when of adult age could begin their career by being
exorcists; children were always placed among the lectors.

³ For Felix of Nola, see Paulinus, Nat. I V. Fet„ v. 104; for Eusebius, st.
J erome, De Viris, 96; for the father of Damasus, for Liberius, Siricius, and
Romulus, 800 inscriptions published in my edition of the Liber Pont„ vol. i.
pp. 213, 210, 217; in the Bull. of De Rossi, 183, p. 17; for Epiphanius, 800
his life by Ennodius (p. 332, Hartel).
