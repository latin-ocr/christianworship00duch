6. Shoes and Head-dress.

Shoes and head-dress also were used as distinguishing
marks of ecclesiastical rank. Not all the clergy had the
right 10 wear the campayz', a sort of slipper which covered
only the heel and toes. As early as the sixth century
this constituted the ceremonial covering of the feet for
the clergy of higher rank in Rome and Ravenna.1 Per-
mission to wear them had to be obtained from the Pope.2
In the histories of the depositione respectively of Pope
Martin and the anti-Pope Constantine,3 we see that in such
cases not only was the wearer deprived of the pallium, but
the straps of his campayi were cut.4

The tiara, in early times, seems to have been a costume
peculiar to the Pope. At all eventS, it is not met with
elsewhere in the West. There 15 110 mention of it in
any document earlier than the life of Pope Constantine
(708-715),⁵ which describes the pope making his entrance
into Constantinople cum camelauoo, ut solitus est Roma

¹ We may 566 1116111 represented in the mosaic-s of the time³ particularly
in those of San Vitale of Ravenna, where they are worn by the emperor,
the officers of his Court, the Bishop of Ravenna and his deacons. One of
the Ordines Romam· mentions them as used by the Roman priests and
deaccns3 the author of the false Donation of Constantine also speaks of
them, but not in very definite 1611115.

² St. Gregory (Ep, viii. 27) forbids the Deacons of Catania to use the
campccyuffi he says that the deaoons of Messina are those alone in the
whole of Sicily who have the privilege of wearing them, a privilege granted
to them by his predecessors.

³ It seems that the campagus of the Pope had something special about it,
for the Greek author of the scholion to the letter of Anastasius the Apocri-
sarius (Migne‚ Pcct. Lat„ vol. cxxix. p. 685) says that he had received
as a relic one of the campayz’ of Pope Martin: uno de campayis ejus, id est
caligis, quos nullus alius ititer homines portat, m'sz' sanctas papa Romanus.
