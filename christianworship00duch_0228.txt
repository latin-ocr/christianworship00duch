206 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITs ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

sang a sacred chent, which St. Germain calls Laudes, or
Alleluia. This was the Sacrificimn, or Offertorium, of the
Mozarabic Liturgy} and the Offerenda of the Milanese.
I append the Mozarabic text of these two chants for the
Nativity:

Laudes:

Alleluia! Redemptionem misit Dominus populo suo: mandavit in
aeternum testamentum suum3 sanctum et terribile nomen ejus. Alleluia l

Sacrificium:

Parvulus natus est nobis et filius datus est nobis3 et factus est
principatus ejus super humeros ejus. Alleluia! Alleluia!

There are ordinarily in the Mozarabic Liturgy two
verses in the Sacrificium, so by combining these two chants
the triple Alleluia was obtained of which St. Germain
speaks, The idea of grouping these arose naturally from
the fact that they originally followed each other immediately.
The prayers, which are at present interposed between them
in the liturgies of Milan and Toledo, are, as I have already
said, not in their original place—at least some of them3
the others are secret prayers‚ which were recited privately
by the officiating priest Whilst the choir was engaged in the
chant.

9. The Pragser of the Veil.

St. Germain does not speak of this. It was preceded
by a kind of preface‚ or invitatory‚ addressed, not to God,
but to the congregation.

vii. 22; Virtutes S. Martini, ii. 253 Vitae PR, viii. 11). We see from
this last text that the stuff out of which it was made could not have
been transparent, for the veil was meant to hide the mysterium corporis
sanguinisque dominici.

¹ Sacrzfieium is the term employed in the liturgical books; offertorium
is found in St. Isidore (loc. cit, 14): “De offertoriis. Offertoria, quae iu
sacrificiorum honore canuntur,’' etc.
