of Christ and of the anniversary of St. Basil. In ancient
authorities on the Gallican custom the Circumcision appears

for instance, at the Council of Tours in 567 (can. 17), in
the Auxerre recension of the Hieronymian Martyrology
(etro. 595), and in the liturgical books of the seventh and
eighth centuries.1 There was, moreover, in countries of

the faithful from the observance of certain riotous festivals
celebrated on the lst of January.
