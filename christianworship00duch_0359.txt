of consecrated 011 and the imposition of hands, during which
the bishop prayed that the Holy Spirit might be given to him.
In his treatise on the resurrection of the flesh, the same
writer sums up in a few words the whole of the baptismal
ritual, and he mentions not only the anointing with chrism,
but the signing with the cross,l and also the first com-
munion: Caro abluitur, ut anima emaculetur ,· caro ungitur,
ut anima consecretur ,· caro siynatur, ut et anima muniatur ;
caro memus impositione adumbratur, ut et amima spiritu
illuminetur ‚· caro corpore et sanquine Christi vescitur, ut ct
anima Deo sayz'mtm2 F inaHy, in his treatise against
Marcion,3 he speaks of the drink of milk and honey ad-
ministered to the neophytes. Testimony is also borne to
this custom in Alexandrian documents subsequent to the
Oanons of Hippolytus.4

We have here nearly all the rites incidental to baptism
and confirmation, at all events those which, in the fourth
century, were universally practised. There is only one rite,
apparently, which 13 not mentioned, and that is the unction
previous to baptism. With regard to this latter I cannot

4 Heri· H. Usener, who has recently given his attention to this rite
(Milch und Honiq, in the Rheinisches Musaeum, vol. lvii. p. 177), endeavours
to connect it with the pagan legend of Dionysus. He is, however, mistaken.
The symbolism of the Promised Laud, with its streams ‘⁶ flowing with milk
and honey,'’ and that of the nourishment of the new-born habe, is amply
sufficient to account for the introduction of this ceremony, without its being
necessary to admit improbable borrowing from paganism.

⁵ See, however, Gcmon. Hipp„ 120. It is possible that this rite may
be much less ancient than the others. At the end of the fourth century
it still had a somewhat uncertain position in the Western ritual. Cf. supra,
p. 318.
