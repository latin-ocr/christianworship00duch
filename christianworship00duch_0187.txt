THE ROMAN MAss. 165

subject to considerable development, especially in the first
part of it, which contains the invocation of Saints. But
the conclusion, in which the response occurs, Te royamus‚
audi 7103, 1105 quite an ancient ring about it, and possesses
a great resemblance to the petitions in the litanies used
in the Greek Ohurch. Although the earliest text in
which it occurs goes back only to the eighth century,
it is probable that it is much more ancient.

It is evident‚ moreover‚ that the place assigned to the
Kyrie eleison in the Roman Litany is not that given to it
in the Eastern Ghurches. In the Roman Litany it occurs
at the beginning and the end, and is said alternately by
the precentor and the congregation. In the East it
formed the people's response to the petitions in the
Diaconal Litany. St. Gregory was already aware of 131115
difference.1 11 arose from the fact that the Kyrie ‚was
adventitious in the Roman Church, as 113 was throughout 13110
entire West.2 The formulary Te royamus, audi nos, however,
could 11013 be omitted, since it occupies in the Roman
Litany the same place as the Kyrie eleison in the Greek.
Another place had 10 be found for the latter. It 15 0
somewhat singular thing that the Kyme, which is of later
date at Rome than the Litany, should now be preserved in

1 Ep. ix. 12: “Kyrie eleison autem nos neque diximus neque dicimus
sicut a Graecis dicitur, quia in Graeciis simul omnes dicunt, apud nos
autem a clericis dicitur et a populo respondetur; et totidem vicibus etiam
Christe eleison dicitur, quod apud Graecos nullo modo dicitur.’'

² Council of Vaison (529), c. 3: “Et quia tam in sede apostolica quam
etiam per totas orientales atque Italiae provincias dulcis et nimium
salutaris consuetudo est intromissa ut Kyrie eleison frequentius cum grandi
affectu et compunctione dicatur,⁷' etc. The Council agreed to the intro-
duction of this custom into the Churches of the province of Aries, in
which it was still unknown. The word intromissa cannot have any
reference to the Eastern Chul-ebes, which, as we know, used the Kyrie
from the remotest times. The drawing up of the Canon is somewhat
defective on this point, but it is clear that the Council of Vaison
regarded the Kyrie then in use at Rome and in Italy (Milan) as an
importation of somewhat recent date.
