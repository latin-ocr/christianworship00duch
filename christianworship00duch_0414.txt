regretted‚ as far as the Roman Church is concerned, that
we have no document relating to its provenance or use
earlier than the beginning of the sixth century. At the
time when it first comes before us, that is, under Pope
Symmachus, the Roman Church was separated from Gon-
stantinople by a schism3 it was therefore not the moment
for her to enjoy Imperial favours. This had been the
situation since the year 484. For several years before
the latter date Rome had ceased to owe allegiance to the
emperors, and had passed under the rule of barbarian
princes We must therefore go back well into the fifth
century to find a favourable time for its institution. On
the other hand, the Bishops of Gaul and Spain1 had,
apart from the Roman pallium, which had been granted to
some of them from the sixth century onward‚ a pallium
which they used as a sign of office, and which appears
to have had the same shape as that worn by the Pope.
This would lead us to believe that the Imperial grant
of this ornament went back to a time when the whole
of Gaul was still Roman, that is to say, to the first half of
the fifth century. The African bishops also wore the pal-
lium as a sign of their office.2 If they held it from the
emperor, they must have received it before the invasion
of the Vandals. It is to the same period that we must
refer the most ancient mention of the pallium found in

¹ St. Germain of Paris, Ep. 2. The first Council of Macen (581) forbade
bishops to celebrate Mass without the pallium: Ut episcopus sine pallio
missas dicere non praesumat. The reading archiepiscopus, which is found
in the printed texts, is merely the editor’s correction; the manuscripts read
episcopus. Of. Loening, Deutsch. Kirchwwoeht, vol. ii. p. 94. For Spain, see
infra, p. 391.

2 Life of St. Fulgentius, ch. 18. St. Fulgentius, out of humility‚ forbore
to wear it: ‘⁶ Orario quidem sicut omnes episcopi numquam utebatur.'’ The
term orarium has no different import: it is used in Spain (Cone. Tol„ iv.
c. 27), and even at Rome (Lib. Pout„ vol. i. p. 472, 1. 3), to denote the
episcopal pallium.
