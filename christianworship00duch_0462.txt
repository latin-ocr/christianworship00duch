lay in the fact that a monk had freely chosen his manner
of life, whereas for the penitent it was a condition of
rehabilitation.1

Such was the discipline with regard to offenders in the
fourth and fifth centuries, but it was not long before it was
mitigated and so modified that, except in extremely rare
cases, the penance lost all its external formalities. and ceased
to have any place assigned to it in public worship.

In early times it had its accompanying ritual, the forms
of which closely resembled those of Christian initiation.
The penitent was regarded in the main as a Christian who
had lost his initiation and was labouring to recover it.
Penance was, as it were, a beginning again of the novitiate‚
or the catechumenate‚ except that the questionings‚ the
scrutinies‚ and the exorcisms were replaced by ascetic
exerciseS. Just as there was a doctor audientiam, or head
catechist‚ assisted by a staff of exorcistS, so there was, in
certain churches, at all events, a penitentiary priest, with
clerks under him, who were entrusted with the care of the
penitents‚ and were responsible for the sincerity of their
expiation. In church, the penitents, like the catechumens‚
constituted a group by themselves, and were dismissed at
the same time as the latter, that is, before the celebration of
the holy mysteries. When at length their 111116 of probation

¹ It should be noted that the monastic state did not, like 1116 penitent,
preclude the taking of Holy Orders. Tho three or four stages of penitential
discipline in the East were never observed in Latin countries (Funk, Theol.
Quartalschrift, 1886, p. 373, et seq.) We may even question, if in the
East they were of universal observance. The Apostolic Constitutione} and
Csnons do not mention them, neither does the Council of Antioch (341)
nor St. John chrysostom. In Syria we see, both by the writings of
St. John Chrysostom and Book Π. of the Apostolic Constitutions, that great
leniency was shown towards penitent sinners. The Constitutions (ii. 16)
assign, 111 proportion to the offence, a greater or lesser duration sor the
penitentia] exercises; but the maximum length of time is seven weeks.
This duration is that of the Oriental Lent, and also of that apparently
observed in Rome during the seventh century. Cf. iufra, p. 438.
