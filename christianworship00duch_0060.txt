40 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITs ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

Milan to Rome. The correspondence between Rome and
Arles became incessant, and the Bishops of Southern Gaul
grew accustomed to proceed to Rome to submit their
disputes to the tribunal of the Pope. We note the presence
of such bishops at the Roman councils of the fifth century.
If the Western Empire had been able to maintain its
existence, an ecclesiastical centralisation similar to that
which had made such vigorous progress in the East‚ would
have been established at an early date in the West. St.
Leo had placed this ecclesiastical concentration under
legal protection by obtaining from Valentinian ΠΙ. 0
recognition of his right to compel the bishops of all the
provinces to appear before his tribunal.l This Western
centralising movement was, however, thwarted by the
rise of the barbarian kingdoms, Political frontiers were
established between Rome and the Churches which lay
beyond the Alps and the scas. The laws and function-
aries of Ravenna had no longer any influence in Vandal
Africa, in Frankish Gaul, and in Visigothic Spain.
Whether Catholic or heretic, the barbarian kings regarded
with but slight favour the maintenance of regular and
frequent communications between their bishops and the
Bishop of Rome, a subject of that power at the expense
of which their own authority had been established. On
13110 other hand, the F rankish and Visigothic sovereigns
soon recognised the necessity of being on good terms
with their bishops. The Roman Imperial officials having
once disappeared, the bishops were found to be the best
qualified representatives of the conquered population, and
numberless occasions arose for an appeal to their moral
authority. Constant relations were thus established between
the various Churches and the sovereign‚ and the Gourt of the
king became the centre of ecclesiastical as of all other affairs.
