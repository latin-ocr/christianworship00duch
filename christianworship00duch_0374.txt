numerous in the fourth and fifth centurias} Those whose
epitaphs have come down to us had, as a general rule,
reached the age of adults, but there were many young
children in the corporation. Their silvery voices penetrated
the vast spaces of the basssicas, and were heard by the most
distant portions of the congregation. In the fulfilment of
their duties, which were of a serious nature for those so
tender in years, they were exposed to the temptation of
playing tricks. The epitaph of Pope Liberius does not
omit to call attention to the good behaviour of which
he gave evidence at this stage of his career ; never had
he been heard to read wrong words wssfully, or to
change the holy text for the amusement of his giddy
companions. The lectors were distributed among the
parochial Churches,2 but this did not prevent their being
grouped according to regions. They came even to be con-
stituted as a corporation (schola lectorum) at an early date,
though the existence of this body at Rome, it is true, is not
attested by any specific document.3 These scholae, however,
were to be found in other Churches,4 and, at Rome, the
schola cantorum, of which there is clear evidence from the

¹ The Constitutum Silvestri gives ninety as the number at Rome. In
484, the clergy of Cart-hage comprised about five hundred persons inter quos
quam plurimi erant lectores infantuli (Victor Vit„ iii. 34). See De Rossi,
Ball„ 1883, pp. 17-22.

Me'lanqes de Z’E'cole de Rome, vol. vii. pp. 55-57.

³ The Gonstitutum Silvestri, after having mentioned the ninety lectors
at Rome, says that their relatives accompanied them to the council. This
does not point to a resident corporation.

⁴ A primicerius scholae lectorum existed at Lyons (Le Blant, 667Α,
inscription of 552); at Tongres or at Rheims, a primicerius scholae elaris-
simae, militiaeque lectorum (Letter of St. Remigius, in Migne‚ Pac. Lat„
vol. lxv. p. 969); at Perre (Pirsin)‚ in the province of the Euphrates, a
primicerius lectorum (Cone. Ghalced„ sess. xiv.); at Carthage (Victor Vit„
loc. cit), a master of these boys is mentioned. Cf. the epitaph of 3 princeps
cantorum sacrosancte aeclisiae Mirtmiae (Myrtilis, in Lusitania), published
by Mons. de Lauriere, in the Bulletin des Antiquam-es de Franco, 1882. P· 217
