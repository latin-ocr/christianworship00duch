GEREMONIES OF CHRISTIAN INITIATION. 295

3. The Gelasian Sacramentary‚ which agrees generally
with the Ordo ,· but here, also, possible Gallican revision
has to be taken into account. ³

The almost complete agreement between the Gelasian
Sacramentary and the Ordo Baptismi proves that the latter
represents the custom of the seventh century at the latest.
From certain details, such as the bilingual formularies, the

employment of the Nicene Creed, the substitution of
acolytes for exorcists‚ we are forced to the conclusion that

this ritual was not finally drawn up until the course of
the seventh century, that is, in Byzantine times,

At this period the baptism of adults had become
exceptionaL and the rites of initiation were ordinarily
confined to infants. Thus the Ordo and the rubrics of
the Sacramentary speak of infants in arms, who are
accompanied by godfathers and godmothers to answer in
their names. It is clear, however, that the formularies were
composed for adults, and that the ceremonies themselves
have only their full significance where persons of riper
years are concerned. It is necessary, therefore, in order
to place the whole in its true h‘ght, to regard the details
which limit the ceremony to infants‚ and thus cause a
chronological transposition of the whole text, as indications
of the work of a reviser. I will endeavour, therefore, to
take this into consideration in the following description.l

1. Rz'tes of the Catachumenate.

The entrance into the catechumenate was accompanied
by the following ceremonies :—

¹ Most of the rites here described are still in use when baptism is
solemnly administered tc adult& but everything takes place at the one
service. In the case of infants‚ the ceremonies are fundamentally the
same, but considerably abridged.
