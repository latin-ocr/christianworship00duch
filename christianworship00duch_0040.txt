20 GHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

Under the latter category‚ mention must be made of
Antioch as one of such centres from the middle of the third
century onwards. On various occasions we find the bishops
of all Syria gathered together there, as well as those of
Eastern Asia Minor, which shortly after was to become the
diocese of Pontus. As early as the year 251 we find mention
of a synod, which must have been held at Antioch, on
account of Fabius, bishop of that place, appearing to favour
N ovatianism. The promoters of this council were the
Bishops of Tarsus, Caesarea in Palestine, and Caesarea in
Cappadocia.1 A few years later, in 256, Dionysius of Alex-
andria,2 in enumerating the Churches of the East which had
been disturbed by this conflict, mentions those of Antioch,
Caesarea in Palestine, AElia (Jerusalem), Tyre, Laodicea in
Syria, Tarsus, and Caesarea in Cappadocia. Subsequently,
from 264 to 268, the case of Paul of Samosata necessitated
the meeting of several bishops at Antioch in the interests of
that Church. On each occasion they come from the same
provinces, from Pontus Polemoniacus (Neocaesarea) and
Lycaonia (Iconium) from as far as Arabia (Bostra) and Pales-
tine (Caesarea, AElia). Immediately after the persecution of
Galerius and Maximianus, a celebrated council was held
at Ancyra, presided over by the Bishop of Antioch, at
which some fifteen bishops from the same countries
were again present, this time, however, the provinces
of Galatia, Bithynia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia are repre-

provincial Priesthood of Rome in the time of Augustus. It is difficult to
imagine a more erroneous idea, or one more at varianoe, both with the
documents and the nature of the institutions thus compared. Those who
originated such a singular notion have allowed themselves to be misled
by an empty resemblance. They have, moreover, refrained from producing
any proofs, and have not studied the question sericusly. When con-
fronted with such a gratuitous statement, Ι cannot do more here than
charitably point out the sruitlessness of their too oft repeated line of
argument.
