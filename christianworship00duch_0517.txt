PEREGRINATIO ETHERIAE (sILvrAE). 49]

Sion, now served by the Armenians. According to tradition, it was the
house in which the disciples met together on the evening of Easter Day,
and eight days after, when the risen Saviour appeared to them. There
also took place the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
In the time of Theodosius it had ceased to be the ordinary place sor
worship. The bishop at that time lived near the Holy Sepulchre, close
to the sanctuarios built by the Emperor Constantine on the sites of the
Passion and the Resurrection.

These sacred buildings were three in number, not reckoning their
dependencies: (1) the Anastasis, or Sanctuary of the Resurrection,
where was the Holy Sepulchre. (2) The Sanctuary of the Cross,
where the true cross and other relies were preserved. This was a double
edifice, one part being the ante Crucem, consisting mainly of a large
courtyard surrounded by cloisters, the other a roofed-in building, of lesser
proportions, known as the post Crucem. (3) The Great Basilica, or
Martyrium, also situated post Crucem. It was in the Anastasis that the
daily offices were said, but the Mass on Sunday, and, generally speaking,
the stations, when there was a large congregation, took place in the
Martyrium. The old church on Mount Sion was only frequented on
the stations of VVednesdays and Fridays, and also on Easter Day ancl its
octave‚ and on Whitsun Day.

Outside Jerusalem, the Basilica of Bethlehem was the appointed place
for meeting, at an early date, on the night of the Epiphany‚ and afterwards
on Ascension Day. Stations were much more frequently held in the
sanctuaries on the Mount of Olives. The most important of these was
the Eleorza (now the Church of the Ascension), where there was a grotto,
in which, according to the tradition of that day, our Lord had held
frequent converse with His disciples. Beyond, in the village of Bethany,
was the Lazarium, or the house of Lazarus3 these two sanctuaries were
chumhes, and Mass could be celebrated in them. Above the Eleona,
and not far from it, was a third sanctuary, which does not appear to have
been a roofed-in building. It was called the Imbomon, and was the
traditional site of the Ascension. This was, doubtless, what is now called
the Viri Galilaei. Other small churches were to be encountered before
reaching Bethany, near to Gethsemane on the slope of the Mount of

Olives.

Etheria writes in vulgar Latin, but not so barbarous in character as that
of the Ογιίηήεε, of which we have already spoken. The vt ord missa has
still for her its primitive meaning of dismissal; she uses it for all
meetings, for the offices as well as for the liturgy, always distinguishing
between the missa of the catechumens and that of the faithful. When
she speaks of a liturgica] meeting properly so called, she uses the terms
oblat-io and procedere. Since the appearance of the first edition of the
