THE RECONGILIATION 01 PENITENTS. 443

prostrate themselves and invoke the Divine mercy. The
formularies preserved closely resemble that of the Missa
paenitentiam in the liturgy of the Apostolic Constitutions.

The archdeacon, then addressing the assembly, both
clergy and laity, calls upon them to cry out, Indulqentz‘a ! 1
When these 61168 have ceased‚ the archdeacon directs the
minds of all present to the “Good Shepherd who giveth
His life for the sheep‚'' and then invites them to unite
in prayer. The bishop then begins a kind of rhythmica]
1itany, to which the congregation respond by fresh 61168 of
Indulqentz'a !

Te precamur, Domine‚—Indulgential
Procedat ab Altissimo—-Indulgential
Succurrat nobis miseris—-Indulgentia 1
Delicta purget omnibus—Indulgentia!
Praestetur paenitentibus—Indulgentia1
Patrona sit lugentibus—Indulgentia!
Errantes fide corrigat—Indulgentia!
Lapsos peccatis erigat—Indulgentia!
Te deprecamur, Domine‚—Indulgeutial

A prayer in the form of a collect follows, pronounced by
the bishop 111 the name of all present, in which he appeals
to the Divine mercy in favour of the penitents.

The 61168 of Indulyentia arise afresh‚ followed by the
litany, and the bishop’s prayer, with other formularies,
but in the same order. This series being terminated‚ it is
taken up 6 third time3 but at the end of the latter the
final prayer 18 omitted, and the service is continued by the
Adoration of the Cross and the Mass of the Preszmetffied,
much as in the present use.

¹ The rubrio of the present Mozarabic Missal takes for granted that
these 61168 are regulated, and not spontaneous; the first time they are not
to be repeated more than three hundred times; the second, not more than
two hundred: and the third, not more than oue hundred times.
