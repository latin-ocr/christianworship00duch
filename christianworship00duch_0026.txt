6 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

masseS. The triumph of the latter was soon expiated by
the destruction of Jerusalem and its sanctuary. Attempts
at reprisals under Trajan, and again under Hadrian, were
promptly suppressed. As a result of these missortunes, the
Jews of the Roman Empire were driven into an increasing

Their former privileges were, nevertheless, maintained,
and in this particular their position was a much stronger
one than that of the Christian communities which had

This separation was the foundation of the Church. It is
