Pro benedictionibus antem quas faciunt Galli, ut nosti, frater, multis
vitiis variant. Nam non ex apostolica traditione hoc faciunt, sed
per vanam gloriam hoc operantur, sibi ipsis damnationem adhibentes,
dum scriptum est: Si quis vobis evangelizaverit praeter iol quod 00111090ῖί-
zatum est, anathema sit. Regulam catholicae traditionis suscepisti, frater
amantissime: sic omnibus praedica omnesque doce, sicut a sancta
Romana, cui Deo auctore deservimus, accepisti ecclesia.

It was during the episcopate of St. Chrodegang (732-
7 66), and very probably after his return from Rome in
754, that the Church of Metz adopted the Roman Liturgy.l
Among all the liturgical innovatione, the most obvious
and most striking was the chant, the Romana cantilena.
This has left more traces than any other innovation in
the books and correspondence of the time. Pope Paul
sent from Rome to King Pepin‚ about the year 760, an
Antiphonti& and a Responso'rial.2 In the same year,
Remedius, son of Charles MarteL and Bishop of Rouen,
having been sent on an embassy to Rome, obtained
permission from the Pope to take back with him the
sub-director (sccundus) of the Schola Ocmtormn, in order
to initiate bis monks “in the modulatioris of psalmody''
according to the Roman method. This teacher having
been shortly afterwards recalled by the Pope, the bishop
sent his Neustrian monks to finish their musical education
at Rome itself, where they were admitted to the School
of Oantors.

These are mere isolated facts. It was owing to a
general measure, a decree of King Pepin, that the Gallican
Use was suppressed. This decree is not forthcoming, but
mention of it is found in the admonitio ,qeneralis put
