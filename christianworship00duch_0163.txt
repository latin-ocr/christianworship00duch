BOOKs or THE LATIN RITE. 141

Verona manuscript the alternatives are far greater in number.
There are five Masses, for instance, for the festival of St.
Oecffia, nine for Christmas and for St. Stephen's Day, eight
for St. Sixtus, fourteen for St. Lamence, twenty-eight for
SS. Peter and Paul, and so forth; as to private MasseS, they

are given ad libitum, and are legion.
In this enormous collection there is, as I have remarked,

more material than arrangement. Thus the Whitsuntide
Mass is inserted among the Masses for the summer Ember
days3 while under the rubrio which announces the anni-
versary of Pope St. Stephen, on the 3rd of August, we find
only the Masses in honour of St. Stephen, the first martyr.
These latter, on the contrary, do not appear in their proper
place, that is, between the festivals of Christmas and St. John
the Evangelist. The Ember days in December are placed
after Christmas. Several Masses pro diversis, or for the
general office of martyrS, are found in impossible months.
There are some, in July, which presuppose that the festival
of Easter is still being kept. Masses to be said on a vigil
are placed aster the festival which they are supposed to
precede. It would be impossible for an official book to
exhibit such a state of disorder.

It should be added that the manuscript contains a

certain number of compositions the presence of which is
inexplicable in such a book. The brothers Ballerini have

pointed out a contradiction between the decree of Gelasius
De recipiendis et own recipiendis libris and one of the Masses
in the Sacramentary in question. It is stated in the latter1
that the apostles Peter and Paul suffered, indeed, on the
same day, but, tempore discreto, in different years Now, the
decree of Gelasius holds this belief to be heretical gossip,
sicut haeretici garriunt, This contradiction would be a
serious one if it were certain, as the brothers Ballerini
