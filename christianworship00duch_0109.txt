THE TWO LITURGIOAL USES OF THE LATIN WEST. 89

must not lose sight of the fact that it has been for centuries
subject to continuous modification in the direction of bring-
ing it more and more into conformity with the Roman
use. This movement suffered no check from the discovery
of printing. Editions after editions of the Ambrosian Missal
became more and more Romanised. But the beginning of
this process goes back to some time before Charlemagne.
It was natural that such should be the case, for Milan
was too near Rome to escape from its influence in this
as in other respects. It adopted at an early date the
Gregorian Canon. In spite, however, of the many modifica-
tions it has experienced‚ the Ambrosian Liturgy preserves
sufficient Gallican features to establish clearly its primitive
identity, in my opinion, at least, with the transalpine
liturgies.1 The facts Ι intend to adduce later on will put
this in a clear light. Ι (10 not bring them forward here
because they would lose something of their significance
if Ι isolated them from the comparative analysis of the
Gallican rites; but Ι think no one will regret giving me
credit in the mean time.

¹ I ought in truth to say that these views have not been accepted
without reserve by the Milanese experts who have taken up the study of
the Ambrosian Liturgy. This difference of appreciation would have given
me more concern if Ι did not feel that it was connected with a tendency,
very natural and worthy of regard in other respects, to exaggerate the
importanoe of this liturgy. It is not willingly admitted that the Ambrosian
rite has been subject to so much Roman revision, and that it is now very
far from its primitive form. I sear I have perhaps given offence in pre-
senting it as a combination, somewhat hybrid in character, of the Roman
and the Gallican. There is a tendency to regar-d it as not only relatively
pure, but that it preserves in it the ancient Latin rite, of which the
Roman 15 a degraded form. Ι cannot accept this view of the matter.
This does not, however, prevent me fron] having a deep interest in the
Ambrosiam Liturgy, and in its preservation and restoration. The Gallicam
Liturgy may be purer in the ancient books, but, like Roland’s mare, which
had otherwise such excellent quantiae, it is dead. At Milan, however
much it may have suffered in its many vicissitudes, it is still living. In
this respect there is compensation for many defeots.
