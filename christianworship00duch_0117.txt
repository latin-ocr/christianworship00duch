THE TWO LITURGIGAL USEs OF THE LATIN WEST. 97

were in question, the Popes could not reply otherwise than
by sending their own books and recommending their own
use. In this manner, little by little, the influence of the
Roman ritual made itself felt. The result was at ¹first the
combination of the two uses3 then by degrees the Roman
use gained the ascendency over the other until at length it
ended by almost completely eliminating the Gallican. The
following are the main facts of the history of this change.

In 538, Profuturus, Bishop of Eraga, the metropolitan of
the Suevic kingdoml of Galicia, wrote to Pope Vigilius to
consult him on certain liturgical points. We still possess
the ,Pope's2 reply. Added to this reply were certain
appendices containing decisions on matters of discipline,
and, in the way of liturgical texts, the order of the
baptismal ceremonies and of the Roman Mass. The latter
contained merely what we call the Ordinary of the Mass,
that is, the part which does not vary, but the Pope
notified to the Bishop of Eraga that it was customary to
add to it in various places formularies peculiar to the
solemnity of the day. Of these formularies, which repre-
sent the greater part of what is called the Liber Sacra-
mentorum, or Sacramentary, Vigilius confines himself to
giving only one specimen, that of the festival of Easter.
He assumes that the Bishop of Eraga could draw up his
own Sacramentary for himself, in case he thought proper
to conform to the Roman ritual. The Pope gives expression
to no order or advice on this point. The liturgical docu-
ments sent by him were nevertheless received in Galicia
with the greatest respect. This was manifested a little later
on, when, after the conversion of the king of the Suevi

¹ The Suevi and their king were at this time still Arians. Their
conversion dates back only to the year 550, or thereabouts.
