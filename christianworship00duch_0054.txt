34 CHRISTIAN WORSHIP: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION.

carried before the tribunal of the Bishop of Milan in the
first instance, probably during the lifetime of St. Ambrose.
It was, indeed, very likely to deal with this business that
the meeting of the Synod of Milan propter adventum
Gallorum episcoporum was held, which was in session when
the news of the massacre at Thessalonica reached Α111101066.1
The Bishops of Octodurus (Martigny) and of Orange were
present.2 They had already attended, a few years before,
in 381, the 0000611 of Aquileia.

Later on, about A.D. 400, the 0000611 of the Bishop of
Milan assembled afresh at Turin, to pass judgment this time
not on one, but on several disputed points which the Churches
of Gaul had referred to it. The following questions were
submitted to it-—the dispute between 13116 Bishop of Mar-
seilles and the bishops of Gallia Narbonensis secunda, the
quarrel for precedence between the Churches of Arles and
Vienne, the difficulty as to communion with Felix of Treves,
and many other points of discipline and law of minor impor-

Bishop of Milan, the most important Bishops of Gaul felt

demnation of Jovinian. The names of Theodore and of Constantius
appear at the end of the synodal letter addressed to Pope Siricius (Ambr.‚
Ep. 42), though without indication of their sees. It is generally admitted
that they may be identified with the two bishops of the same names who

took part in the 00011611 of Aquileia—that is, the Bishops of Octodurus and
of Orange.
