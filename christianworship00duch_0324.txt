noster J esus Christus ad suam sanctam gratiam et benedictionem fontem-
que baptismatis dono 1 vocare dignatus est. Et hoc signum sanctae
crucis frontibus eorum quod nos damus, tu, maledicte diabole, numquam
audeas violare.

After each of the exorcists had performed his fonction
in turn, the catechumens were invited to prostrate them-
selves and pray, signing themselves with the sign of the
cross. A priest then approached‚ and repeated the cere-
mony of the signing and the imposition of hands, while
saying—

Aeternam ac justissimam pietatem tuam deprecor, domine sancte,
Pater omnipotens, aeterne Dens luminis et veritatis, super hos famulos
et famulas tuas, ut digneris eos inluminare lumine intelligentiae tuae.
Munda eos et sanctifica3 da eis scientiam veram, ut digni efficiantur

accedere ad gratiam baptismi tui. Teneant firmam spem, consilium
rectum, doctrinam sanctam, ut apti sint ad percipiendam gratiam tuam.

It is to be noted that the priest‚ instead of following
the exorcists in conjuring the devil, merely makes his prayer
to God. It was not his office—at least, at this moment-—
to conjure the demon. After a final prostratim, the
catechumens resume their places, and the Mass proceeds
in their presence up to the Gospel. Before the reading
of this they were dismissed. Their relations or sponsore,
however, took part in the offering. The names of the
latter were recited in the Memento, but those of the elect
were included in the Hanc igitur, with a special recom-
mendation.2

These exorcisms were repeated in the same manner,
and with the same accompaniments‚ on the other days of
the scrutiny‚ except the seventh. The third day possessed
a special importance. It was on this day that the candidate
was officially instructed in the Gospel, the Oreed, and the

has, however, given per in place of et.
