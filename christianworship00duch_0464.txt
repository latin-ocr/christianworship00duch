On the Wednesday 1 in capite jejunii, which we now
0611 Α611 Wednesday,2 the penitent presented himself be-
fore the priest in the early morning, that is, before the
procession to the stational Mass, and received from him
a hair-shirt‚ in which he was clothed during the recital of
a prayer, the text of which is not given. This is in
the main the same ceremony as that prescribed by the
Council of Agde. There is no reason to doubt that in
Rome this ceremony may not have been in use much
earlier than the seventh century. The more modern
element in it is the choice of Ash Wednesday for its
performance‚ and also the seclusion of the penitent in
a monastery. As late 66 the middle of the fifth century
the penitents at Rome were left to themselves, and were
neither secluded nor subjected to official supervision.3

The custom of seclusion naturally obviated the solemn
dismissal of the penitents <missa paonitentiam) 613 13116
public Mass. The Latin Sacramentaries have preserved
no vestige of this usage, but in the Greek books, and
especially in the Apostolic Constitutions, it is other-
wise, for 111 them we note the group of penitente, present

² Neither the Gelasian Sacramentary nor the Ordo I. of Mabillon, which
describes the station of the Wednesday in capite jejunii, mentions the bene-
diction or the imposition of ashes; but the existing ceremony is given at
length in the Ordines of the twelfth century. It corresponds with 6 wider
conception of penance. All the faithful, clei-gy and laity, adopt the
attitude of penitents for the Lenten season, and receive the imposition of
ashes, which are, like the hair-shirt, the symbol of a state of penitence.
Such an idea, particularly in relation 130 the clei-gy. is irreconcilable with

the ancient penitentiary legislation observed in Rome down to the ninth
century.
