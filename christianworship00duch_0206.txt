8. The Fraotz'on of the Bread.

The Canon having come to an end, the Pater noster
follows According to universal custom, it has a short
introductory preface, and at the end an elaboration of the
last petition (Libera nos).

Before the time of St. Gregory, the fraction of the
bread followed immediately upon the Canon. It was
he who transferred the Pater noster 130 this place, on the
ground that it was hardly proper that the formulary
of the Canon, the work of some unknown scholar,
should alone be recited over the oblation, to the exclusion
of the prayer composed by our Lord Himself.l This
transposition, although St. Gregory defends himself from
the accusation of having followed any authority in intro-
ducing it, had the effect of bringing the Roman use into
conformity with that of Constantinople.

The ceremony which follows is seemingly complicated.
It begins with the kiss of peace, which is placed imme-
diately after the salutation, Pam Domini sic semper
vobiscum. The Pope places in the chalice the fragment
of consecrated bread which had been brought to him at
the beginning of the Mass; he then breaks one of his own
two oblatae, and places one half of it upon the altar.
We have not yet come to the fraction of the bread‚
properly speaking, but as all the loaves upon the altar

¹ Ep. ix. 12 (26): “Orationem vero dominicam idcirco mox post
precem dicimus, quia mos apostolorum fuit ut ad ipsam solummodo
orationem oblationis hostiam consecrarent. Et valde mihi inconveniens
visum est ut precem quam scholasticus composuerat super oblationem
diceremus, et ipsam traditionem quam Redemptor noster composuit super
ejus corpus et sanguinem non diceremus. Sed et dominica oratio apud
Graecos ab omni populo dicitur, apud nos vero a solo sacerdote.'' We are*
not obliged to believe, in spite of the authority of this text, that the
Apostolic Liturgy knew of no other formulary but the Pater noster, but
it is difficult to argue against St. Gregory’s having thought so.
