ORDINATION. 351

notice here, in general, to the Leonian Sacramentary
and that of Pope Adrian. They contain identically the
same prayers for the ordination of deacons‚ priests, and
bishops‚ and nothing else. There is no mention in them
of any of the orders below the diaconate.

3. The Ordines Romani.—-I have three of these to
specify: (a) that of the manuscript of St. Amand,1 which
contains only the Roman ordinations at the Ember seasons,
that is, those of deacons and priests3 (b) the Ordo VIII.
of Mabillon, which contains in addition the ordination
of the inferior orders, together with that of bishops3 (c)
the Ordo IV. of Mabillon‚ in which are given the cere-
monies in regard to deacons‚ priests, bishops‚ and the
Pope himself. The three Ordines agree in the main with
each other, and the ceremonies which they describe fall
in exactly with those implied in the two Sacramen-
taries.

4. The Gelasian Sacramentary and the Missale Franco-
rum—These two compilations surnish us with the com-
plete ritual for all the orders 3 but a slight examination
is enough to convince us that they contain many things
derived from widely different sources, We find therein (a)
a passage of a letter from Pope Zosimus on the intervals
of time between the orders32 (b) Chapters Ι. to X. of the
Statum Ecclesiae Antiqua 33 (ο) ordination prayers sor
the five inferior orders 3 4 (d) prayers for the ordination
of deacons, priests, and bishops.5 In the last portion,
the Roman prayers, that is, those found in the Leonian
Sacramentary and the Sacramentary of Adrian, are embodied
