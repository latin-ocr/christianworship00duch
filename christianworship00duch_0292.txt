commemorative of both St. J ames and St. John. It is in—
serted as such in the Carthage Calendar, the Hieronymian
Martyrology, and the Gallican liturgical books. In this,
as in many other respects, the Gallican usage agrees with
the Oriental.

At Rome, on the other hand, the commemoration of
St. John alone was adopted. At Constantinople the two
apostles were transferred to two other days in the calendar.

As for the apostles Peter and Paul, their common
festival was celebrated in the West on the 29111 of June,
a practice which goes back at least to the time of Con-
stantine. The Eastern anniversary of these saints, the
28111 of December, could not disturb such a deeply rooted
tradition. At Constantinople also the Roman date was
adopted from an early period.l In other Eastern countries
it was found practicable to combine 1116111.2

The festival of the Holy Innocents must have been
instituted at an early date, that is, some time in the fifth
century. It is found on the 28111 of December in all the
ancient Latin calendars and liturgical books from the sixth
century3 onwards. The Ohurch of Constantinople has also
this festival, but places it a day later, that 15, 011 1116 29111 of

¹ cod. meod„ xv.. v.‚ 5; 1116 law belongs 10 1116 year 425; its terms
are somewhat vague, but they seem to point 10 the festival of the mouth
of June. It was celebrated at Constantinople at the end of the fifth
century (Theod. Lect.‚ ii. 16).

2 The festival was still celebrated at Jerusalem in the mouth of December,
in the seventh century, as we learn from a homily of Bishop Sophronius
(Migne, Pat. Gr„ vol. lxxxvii. p. 3361). The festival of St. Stephen
took place on the 27111, 611(1 11161 of the apostles vPeter and. Paul on
the 28111.

³ My remarks here are about the festival, and not of the mention of the
Innocents in hymns, as in Prudentius, or in 11011111165, 65 111 111056 of st.
Peter Ohrysologus.

4 The term Innocents is peculiar to Roman liturgical language. The
Calendar of Carthage and the Gallican books employ the word Infantes.
